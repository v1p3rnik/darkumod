 POLITICS_DARK_BUDDHIST_DESC:0 "A mysterious persona, Dark Buddhist, as the only moniker of his goes, has made it all the way up to the undisputed ruler of Czechoslovakia. Aided by his many friends and supporters, he sits on the throne in his Palace in Praha. He is a man of action, decisive, swift on his feet and very wise."
 PEETRY_DESC:0 "Emperor's brother, Peetry, is a wise and old man. He has seen a lot, and does not say much, but he does not tolerate any bullcrap and will not be kind to any degenerates or malcontents. Was seen keeping close ties to Slovakians."
 LADIFOUR_DESC:0 "A fervent revolutionary, Ladifour is convinced that Communism is the right path. He will gladly debate this with anyone, and eventually convince them that this is indeed the correct path. Also, it seems that he is strangely fond of \"traps\". The jury is still out there whether or not this means constricting mechanisms or something completely different."
 SPACEFOX_DESC:0 "SpaceFox is a democrat to the core, despite his upbringing in extremely traditionalist family.

 DARK_COMMIE_DESC:0 "Surprising literally everyone, Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist's rhetoric transformed from a traditionalist-royalist one to a firm Communist. Adopting his own, personalised version of the teaching of Karl Marx, he now leads his very own crusade against injustice and oppression of the masses in the world."
 DARKEST_DESC:0 "Do you really think\nThat I would ever let you go?\nDid you think I'd set you free?\nIf you do I'm sad to say,\nIt simply isn't so.\nYou will never get away from me!\nAll that you are\nIs a face in the mirror!\nI close my eyes and you dissapear.\nI'm what you face\nWhen you face in the mirror!\nLong as you live, I will still be here.\nAll that you are\nIs the end of a Nightmare.\nAll that you are is a dying scream.\nAfter tonight, I shall end this\nDemon's dream!"
 HOLY_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "This most holy committee oversees all matters of the Revolution, leading us to a better, brighter world, where we are all equal before the Holy Revolution's gaze!"
 DARKER_DESC:0 "Voice of Friendship is the name Dark Buddhist started using after becoming the leader of FSO's fascist movement. A truly unexpected turn of events, some might say, while others gossip that he has merely done this to stay in power. Regardless, all have a lot more reasons to fear what's coming to them..."

 FSO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Friendship Order! A new nation formed out of nowhere in what was previously known as Czechoslovakia. As the democratic government of the country is dissolved under pressure from the military, Dark Buddhist is crowned the Emperor of this new nation. What lies in the future, though? The communists, fascists, democrats and royalists battle for influence, hoping to secure their own vision for the Friendship Order, but Dark Buddhist himself is not going to stay uninvolved, either..."
