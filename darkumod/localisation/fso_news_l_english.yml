 fsonews.1.t:0 "Friendship Union Joins Comintern"
 fsonews.1.d:0 "Official sources state that today the diplomats from the Friendship Union and Soviet Union signed a treaty effectively listing the former as a military ally and a member of Comintern.\n\nSuch a change in the balance of power in Europe will surely increase the Soviet influence in the West and empower the communist movement as a whole. Leader of Germany, Adolf Hitler, states in a speech: 'This pact is threatening safety and security of Europe as a whole and, more importantly, the safety and security of Germany, german people. We will not stand idle and watch.'"
 fsonews.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.1.b:0 "The germans cower!"
 fsonews.1.c:0 "We have nothing to fear from the Germans under the Bear's protection."
 fsonews.2.t:0 "Leon Trotsky Finds a Safe Haven"
 fsonews.2.d:0 "Information is spreading about the exiled soviet politician Leon Trotsky. It has been confirmed today that he has found safety in the fledgeling Friendship Union.\n\nWhether or not this will cause turbulence in the Prague-Moscow relations remains unclear, but the Supreme Leader of Friendship Union speaks openly against Stalin's policies."
 fsonews.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.2.b:0 "They will pay for sheltering that fool!"
 fsonews.2.c:0 "Soviets would not dare attack us!"
 fsonews.3.t:0 "Military Intervention In Austria"
 fsonews.3.d:0 "Today official sources in Austria have confirmed that the conflict with the Friendship Union was not a mere border war as was stated previously by [AUS.GetNeutralParty]'s leader. Elite forces of the Friendship Union were seen in Vienna and Graz, securing key infrastructure while a communist government established itself in the parliament.\n\nThe new Austrian leader, [AUS.GetLeader], is a staunch follower of Cutie-Marxism and proclaims eternal friendship with the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist. It seems that the German plans in that region are now completely thwarted, and Berlin will almost certainly not be happy. This spread of communist ideas in Central Europe also concerns other major nations such as Italy and Britain."
 fsonews.3.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.3.b:0 "No longer a German puppet!"
 fsonews.3.c:0 "Friendship is unstoppable!"
 fsonews.4.t:0 "Friendship Union And German Reich Pact"
 fsonews.4.d:0 "In a somewhat surprising communique from Berlin today, the Reichschancellery states that in light of unannounced 'recent developments' the German Reich has reconsidered its approach to the fledgeling Friendship Union.\n\nThe message mentions a delegation of diplomats from the latter, and a special treaty 'Of Spheres Of Influence In Central Europe' signed between the two powers. For the past few days, the German aggressive rhetoric towards former Czechoslovakia and talks of claims over Sudetenland have subsided into nothingness, and it seems that at least for now this region will see peace and stability."
 fsonews.4.a:0 "I believe it is peace for our time."
 fsonews.5.t:0 "Friendship Union Manifests Destiny"
 fsonews.5.d:0 "Today in a radio announcement the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist held a speech for the people of Friendship Union, proclaiming that their recent successes and expansion is proof of the righteousness of their 'Cutie Crusade', mentioning also the fact that there are still states left in Europe that do not comply with the same ideology. He urged his 'friends and allies' to 'muster the forces and gather the armies' for the 'coming liberation of the enchained'.\n\nThis is definitely an aggressive speech indicative of the expansionist intent, and only time will tell what comes of this."
 fsonews.5.a:0 "Interesting times."
 fsonews.5.b:0 "We will bury them!"
 fsonews.5.c:0 "We will fight to the last!"
 fsonews.6.t:0 "United Union of Unions Forms"
 fsonews.6.d:0 "The news of the Soviet Union's capitulation are still fresh, when today we are hit with another news!\n\nThe new regime installed by the Supreme Leader Dark Buddhist is gaining a lot of popularity across the former Soviet territory, with people praising 'just and wise' rulership. The formal allies of Friendship Union have also been lately talking about a possible formation of 'cutie-marxist superstate'.\n\nFinally, today Dark Buddhist proclaimed the integration of all controlled and allied territories of Cutie Marx Crusaders into United Union of Unions, a superstate spanning from Portuguese tip to Vladivostok. All are invited to join in a 'harmonious utopia of talents'."
 fsonews.6.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.6.b:0 "We are supreme!"
 fsonews.7.t:0 "Leon Trotsky Back In Power"
 fsonews.7.d:0 "Following Stalin's defeat, it seems like the power vacuum in the Soviet Union will be filled with ease. Comrade [SOV.GetLeader], Dark Buddhist's loyal aide and ideological ally, will lead the new Soviet Union 'on the path of just and proud talent seeking crusade', following the model of Supreme Leader Dark.\n\nThe new nation is going to be aligned completely with the Friendship Union and together they are likely to forge a new world order."
 fsonews.7.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.7.b:0 "Welcome back, comrade Trotsky!"
 fsonews.7.c:0 "Together to the stars!"
 fsonews.8.t:0 "Allied Powers Yield To Friendship Union"
 fsonews.8.d:0 "A string of defeats in the Middle East has led the Allied powers to the negotiations table with the Friendship Union. An upstart nation has impressed everyone with their swift and efficient blitz across the Balkans and into Syria and the Holy Land. A number of generals mentioned that they 'have never experienced fighting a foe so fierce before' in their lives.\n\nThe exact terms of the armistice remain disclosed, however observers state that they see Allied troops leaving the contested region beyond the Gaza-Sinai line into Egypt. Allied envoys have also reportedly left the courts of middle eastern countries, leaving them alone. The remaining leaders already announced a new defensive pact."
 fsonews.8.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.8.b:0 "It was a necessity."
 fsonews.8.c:0 "We have achieved a great victory today!"
 fsonews.9.t:0 "Friendship Union Emigrates"
 fsonews.9.d:0 "In an unprecedented operation, the Sudeten crisis was solved today by the combined effort of United Kingdom, Germany, Friendship Union and Soviet Union. The entire population, government and army moved into unpopulated territories of Argentina and Chile, although the capital area of Buenos Aires is now lost, too. President of the United States deemed these actions unlawful and unjustified."
 fsonews.9.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.9.b:0 "This is in violation of Monroe Doctrine!"
 fsonews.9.c:0 "We tricked them all!"
 fsonews.10.t:0 "Dawn of U.S.S.A."
 fsonews.10.d:0 "What could not be imagined merely a few years ago has come to be, as both American continents now stand united under the flag of the Friendship Union. To allow for easier and more efficient organisation, the Plebeian Assembly agreed to form a new state, the United Soviet Socialist America, which encompasses all of the New World territories."
 fsonews.10.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.10.b:0 "Truly a new era awaits!"
 fsonews.11.t:0 "Friendship Union Annexes Paraguay"
 fsonews.11.d:0 "Earlier this week the nation of Paraguay, where the communist revolution successfully secured the government, officially requested integration into the Friendship Union. The Plebeian Assembly immediately decreed this as an official act, indicating weeks of prior negotiation. This will certainly spread influence of the Union in South America."
 fsonews.11.a:0 "Para what?"
 fsonews.11.b:0 "Surely, no one even knows where Paraguay is on the map."
 fsonews.12.t:0 "Statue Of Equality Built In Rio"
 fsonews.12.d:0 "The ripples from recent reports of destruction of the statue of Christ the Redemptor in Rio de Janeiro have not subsided yet, and another report about this story is already in!\nIt appears that the Friendship Union and the Plebeian Assembly has decided to use the materials left from the statue to build their own. The new Statue of Equality depicts a worker raising his hammer high up in the sky, and the rumour says that the statue is intentionally poised to point towards New York. The official representatives in Nova Praha have denied these allegations."
 fsonews.12.a:0 "Is this some kind of cold war?"
 fsonews.12.b:0 "Ours is better!"
 fsonews.13.t:0 "Unprovoked Nuclear Attack On [fso_nuked.GetName]!"
 fsonews.13.d:0 "A shocking, disasterous tragedy! The Friendship Union, for the longest time a closed fortress of a country in the middle of Central Europe, reopened diplomatic relations - if you can call it that. A weapon of untold power has been unleashed on a peaceful territory in [fso_nuked.GetName] earlier this week. This unprovoked act of aggression has taken the world community by surprise, as even the Comintern denounced its ideological ally as 'despicable terrorists'. It is unknown as of yet why the attack was staged, as the leaders of Friendship Union have not made an official statement on anything in many months.\nDiplomats from all over the world are now gathering in Paris to discuss this unexpected horrifying threat to the safety of Europe and the entire world."
 fsonews.13.a:0 "The loss of life is devastating."
 fsonews.13.b:0 "But... they attacked us?.."
 fsonews.14.t:0 "'Atomic Bomb' Deployed By Friendship Union?"
 fsonews.14.d:0 "[fso_nuked.GetName], a country in a state of war with the Friendship Union, has made a press statement today describing a horrific act of war - a bomb of extreme destructive power was detonated earlier this week in a major city, and many thousands civilians have died in the blast. It is unknown, however, whether the attack was directed at the military, as the press release states the majority of the strike was directed at the population centers. In a passionate speech the leader of [fso_nuked.GetName], [fso_nuked.GetLeader], states that 'to defend the entire human race and civilisation, with all its core values and culture, we must unite against a common enemy which our nation has been fighting many years now'. The diplomats from all over the world are convening in the capital of [fso_nuked.GetName] to negotiate a united front."
 fsonews.14.a:0 "We have to stop them NOW!"
 fsonews.14.b:0 "The whole world now turns against us!"
 fsonews.15.t:0 "Pax Amicitiae"
 fsonews.15.d:0 "In a stunning effort by more than fifty nations, united in friendship, the city of Utopia Praga is complete! This marvel of construction technology, cultural achievements and spiritual strength of the Friendship Order is surely not going to be forgotten or ignored by anyone!"
 fsonews.15.a:0 "Friendship, eh..."
 fsonews.15.b:0 "We are victorious. YOU are victorious!"
 fsonews.16.t:0 "Troubling Developments in FSO!"
 fsonews.16.d:0 "Various observers already mentioned this in the past, but today we have received a testimony of an exiled minister which confirms our suspicions - the Friendship Order has reformed into a nationalistic regime similar to those in Italy and Germany.\nOnly time will tell how this will affect the European political climate as a whole. UK Prime Minister and the French leader publicly denounced their old pledges made towards Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler expressed uncanny interest in the new FSO leadership."
 fsonews.16.a:0 "Troubling."
 fsonews.16.b:0 "Let them be afraid."
 fsonews.17.t:0 "Hamburg Performance!"
 fsonews.17.d:0 "Touring across the Friendship order turned out to be a great success. Axis Girls with their innocent approach yet clear ideological affinity works great as unifying force in a still divided society. Soon the bickering of political views turned everyone around into a big group of fans. In a way, Axis Girls performances gave the feeling of unity even to people who do not share the political views of our new government. Who would have thought that they can turn a nation into a constant party?\nFSO Girls surely know how to unite not just people of one land, but to bring the entire axis leaning world together. Maybe people from Soviet Union and rest of the world will not see the Axis as some evil dangerous pact, but as actual humans instead, who just wish to see more order and unity?\nSince other leaders very much liked the idea of closer, yet unofficial integration, a grand tour was planned. First stop – Hamburg in Germany. The concert itself was indeed magnificent. German fans were already well aware of their activities within our border and shown much excitement to see them on their own soil.\nAxis Girls are meanwhile steadily growing into not a Czech group, but truly Axis group with volunteer young ladies coming from all Europe and beyond to sing, play and write new songs."
 fsonews.17.a:0 "Interesting."
 fsonews.17.b:0 "Our girls are the best!"
 fsonews.18.t:0 "Danzig Performance!"
 fsonews.18.d:0 "This disputed city and center of attention of two important players in Europe needs to chill!\nAfter staggering success in the German Reich, nobody really expected any bigger success in Poland, which does have some Axis Girls fans, but by far not as many as axis-leaning nations. Despite this political background they did prepare a very nice stage and enough people showed up, although the tickets were not sold out.\nOpening song was “Welcome to the Show” as always. Some new titles were added and the team leader cleverly added songs that would speak more to local population more than to the Germans. In the end, it all ended with a success and probably a whole new bunch of Axis Girls fans."
 fsonews.18.a:0 "Yay."
 fsonews.18.b:0 "Axis Girls Rock!"
 fsonews.19.t:0 "Uppsala Performance!"
 fsonews.19.d:0 "Our girls crossed the Baltic Sea this time and arrived to beautiful historical city in Sweden named Uppsala.\nThe “neutral” Swedes made even better stage, honoring the location by placing two old cannons on the close-by hill and firing them with the first song. First visit to Sweden ever surely started magically for this cute musical delegation. Performance was as good as every fan expected, although no new songs were introduced and some of the girls obviously need some rest.\nTheir crowd was formed mostly by already existing fans, occupying the area immediate to the stage, while some curious customers and local residents approached their concert from longer distance, some being caught by their magic and drawn into the crowd, while others just gave them a short listen and left.\nOverall, it was more successful show than the Polish one and definitely made some new fans in the north."
 fsonews.19.a:0 "Peculiar."
 fsonews.19.b:0 "Everyone will love them soon enough!"
 fsonews.20.t:0 "Helsinki Performance!"
 fsonews.20.d:0 "Final stop of the first ever Axis Girls Tour is here! This time they bomb of magic was dropped on the capitol of Finland, Helsinki.\nSong list was adjusted for the Finnish fans, with harder instruments and darker lyrics, yet still staying true to their core style. Stage was moderate, yet big enough for a good performance and enough people showed up for Axis Girls to claim this stop as success as well.\nLast concert so far was concluded by a rewritten and remade version of the song “Better than ever”, which served as symbol to demonstrate their great impact on European fans and their quick ascension to prominence. Some voices arisen across the “Allied” world, noting the overly fanatical behavior of AG fans and their obvious loyalty to their homeland and its political faction, although no actual steps were taken as usual.\nTeam of producers actually mentioned in Helsinki, that a new tour outside the axis sphere of influence is being planned. Make a big visit to Britain, and claim their hearts as much as they did at home."
 fsonews.20.a:0 "Cool."
 fsonews.20.b:0 "Britain will fall to their charms!"
