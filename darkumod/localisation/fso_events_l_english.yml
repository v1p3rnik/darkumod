 fso.1.t:0 "Order 69"
 fso.1.d:0 "The people of Czechoslovakia have happily accepted the formation of a new nation, The Friendship Order. From all around the world people flock under the banners of a new country, seeking security and safety in these dark times. Under the leadership of Emperor Dark Buddhist, protected by his Praetorian Guard, the people feel a state of gaiety. The crowned Emperor's first decree is Order 69 - establishment of the Senate as the lawmaker body of the Order. The early days of a nation, however, are most turbulent, and who knows what time will bring..."
 fso.1.a:0 "Time will tell."
 fso.2.t:0 "Crowds Gather"
 fso.2.d:0 "The first Senate is now in session. But an unexpected issue appeared out of nowhere: a massive crowd gathered in front of the Senate, demanding to be let inside to participate!.."
 fso.2.a:0 "The Guards start letting the people inside..."
 fso.2.b:0 "Praetorian Guard starts beating the more vocal speakers in the crowd..."
 fso.2.c:0 "The Emperor graciously lets the people of the Order into the halls..."
 fso.2.dd:0 "Peetry shouts obscenities from the windows to drive the crowds away..."
 fso.3.t:0 "First Friendship Festival"
 fso.3.d:0 "Time of celebration! Emperor proclaims the first ever Friendship Festival. People are rejoiced and are having fun all across the nation! A group of military veterans approached Dark Buddhist and asked for permission to hold a grand military parade. It is all just for funsies, is it not?"
 fso.3.a:0 "It is the Friendship Festival! What could go wrong?.."
 fso.3.b:0 "Perhaps our plebs and Tribune can one up the militarists..."
 fso.3.c:0 "We must ask the crowd if they want to see the parade, first..."
 fso.3.dd:0 "Of course we allow the parade! What an excellent idea!.."
 fso.4.t:0 "International Recognition of the Order"
 fso.4.d:0 "The people seem content, however we are still ridiculed and gossiped about in other countries. To show others our friendly intentions, Emperor Dark Buddhist throws a massive party - and all the world leaders are invited! However, the Senate is split into camps, and all because they cannot agree on the main dishes for the upcoming party! The horror! It looks like the Emperor needs to step in."
 fso.4.a:0 "Tea and biscuits, obviously!.."
 fso.4.b:0 "Just let the Praetorian Guard cook something..."
 fso.4.c:0 "Sausages, pizza and Sushi for all!.."
 fso.4.dd:0 "Potatoes, bread and caviar, feed as many as possible..."
 fso.5.t:0 "The Dead Senator"
 fso.5.d:0 "During one of the post-session banquets in the Senate, one of the influential Senators was found dead on the street - it appears he fell out of one of the windows... or was this a murder? The public is in uproar, and all call for an investigation! The Praetorians secured the assumed murder scene, but whom will the Emperor appoint on such a delicate case?"
 fso.5.a:0 "Appoint a group of trusted military officers, veterans, Emperor's friends..."
 fso.5.b:0 "It is the Senate's business, let the Senate appoint investigators..."
 fso.5.c:0 "We can only trust the Praetorian Guard in this case..."
 fso.5.dd:0 "The Plebeian Assembly will appoint the investigators for this horrible murder..."
 fso.6.t:0 "The Dust Settles"
 fso.6.d:0 "The recent events forged our society and government in ways we could not predict. Now we are reaching the pivotal point of our nation's short existence, and the dust settles..."
 fso.6.a:0 "Another event, declaring our path, will occur soon."
 fso.7.t:0 "Plebeian Assembly Supremacy Act"
 fso.7.d:0 "The Friendship Order has changed, and drastically so. The people, formerly supporting the autocratic (albeit fair and just) rule of Dark Buddhist, are now calling for measures to be implemented to transfer more power to the Plebeian Assembly. With widespread support and influence even in the Senate, and in light of recent events, the Assembly successfully pushed through the Plebeian Assembly Supremacy Act, giving it superiority over the Senate as the law making body. The Emperor is still formally in power, however, as the national love for him is ever present."
 fso.7.a:0 "Power to the people of Friendship Order!"
 fso.8.t:0 "Officer Corps seizes the Senate"
 fso.8.d:0 "Military influence is spread across the cities of Friendship Order. More and more people are criticizing the Senate for its divided nature, blaming more and more of daily problems on the \"lazy Senators in togas pretending to be Romans\". Playing off the nationalistic and militant tendencies of the public, the Patricii Officer Corps has seized majority in the Senate. The Plebeian Assembly is closed, and effectively now they can dictate the laws, and it appears that their definition of \"friendly\" is rather perverted..."
 fso.8.a:0 "Freundschaft uber alles!"
 fso.9.t:0 "Peace and Stability"
 fso.9.d:0 "Despite the storm of recent events, the Emperor and his Guard have held onto the reins of power well enough. The Senate is functioning, Plebeian Assembly is more or less content, and the populace in general is happy. The radical tendencies are in decline, and people are now firmly believing in Friendship utopia under the visionary rule of Emperor Dark Buddhist. All Hail Emperor Dark!"
 fso.9.a:0 "Ave Imperator, Caesar invicta!"
 fso.10.t:0 "Of Liberties and Freedoms"
 fso.10.d:0 "The Emperor's attention given to the Senate has not gone unnoticed in the public. Farther and wider people are talking how great the Senate is and how noble the Senators are, how much they do for the people and the economy, protecting the nation's interests. Even the Plebeian Assembly has been cooperating with the Senate more than bickering. As a result, the Senate gained a lot more power, and the Order can now be properly called a democratic state. However, the role of Emperor Dark is still undecided under these new conditions."
 fso.10.a:0 "The Senate and People or Friendship Order are going to manifest their own destiny!"
 fso.11.t:0 "Emperor Bamboozled"
 fso.11.d:0 "The Guards allowed the people into the Senate halls under the choir of cheering crowds. The Senate, shellshocked and confused, immediately agreed to form the Plebeian Assembly, and it has gained immediate influence among the people, especially the lower class. Only time can tell what will come of this. The Emperor was greatly mispleased to learn of this."
 fso.11.a:0 "Surely the Guards should ask him first?"
 fso.12.t:0 "Bold Measures"
 fso.12.d:0 "Praetorians beat the more vocal orators down until the Emperor steps in, preventing the fight between the crowds and guardsmen. As a compromise, the Senate creates the Plebeian Assembly, which seems to have appeased the crowds enough. Regardless, there is a certain fear and minor stigma against the Guard now, and some members of our Officer Corps used this to secure personal influence, especially now that the plebs have quieted a bit."
 fso.12.a:0 "They are friends to the Emperor, it should not be an issue."
 fso.13.t:0 "Free People in a Free Nation"
 fso.13.d:0 "Benevolent as he is, Emperor Darku allows the people in. The crowds cheer and hail the Emperor's kindness. In a big ceremony the Senate officially creates the Plebeian Assembly, allowing plebs to participate in the law making process. This increased Senate's popularity somewhat."
 fso.13.a:0 "They better not forget who let them in in the first place!"
 fso.14.t:0 "Angery Doge"
 fso.14.d:0 "The cursing is so incredibly convoluted and offensive that the crowds are shocked. A few more brave ones muttered quietly "no u" and "your mum gay", but their voices are unheard. Confused crowds are just shambling around the square. Finally, the Emperor himself, escorted by the Guard, opened the Senate doors and let the people in. There, he formed the Plebeian Assembly to help the plebs represent their interests. The crowds disperse in peace and hail the wise Emperor."
 fso.14.a:0 "Peetry is a good Guard."
 fso.15.t:0 "Lenin Cake"
 fso.15.d:0 "Emperor allows the parade, however he decides to encourage the plebs to do something just as exciting. After consideration, Tribune and the plebs present their Festival attraction - a huge, massive cake with an even bigger Lenin on top! They move the cake through the streets of Prague with cheering and pony music mixed with Internationale. Crowds are ecstatic and will remember this event."
 fso.15.a:0 "The Emperor would like to get a slice of that cake."
 fso.16.t:0 "The Parade"
 fso.16.d:0 "Emperor Dark's enthusiasm inspired the veterans and officers, and they tried to make it as pompous as possible. All available military forces participated in it, and the crowds were allowed to parade alongside soldiers and military machines of war. It ended with an amazing air show of the entire Air Force. The crowds are filled with national pride now."
 fso.16.a:0 "We can direct it at our enemies!.. Wait, I thought we were friendly?"
 fso.17.t:0 "Parade Poll"
 fso.17.d:0 "Emperor privately addresses the Senate to help him solve the dilemma at hand. The Senate holds a nationwide poll asking for popular opinion of the parade. It does not really decide anything, because most people are indifferent to it. However, the Senate's popularity is now increased as they are viewed as the decisive force of action. The parade is now secondary in most headlines."
 fso.17.a:0 "The Senate? A force of action? Hah!"
 fso.18.t:0 "No Harm Indeed"
 fso.18.d:0 "Dark Buddhist allows the parade. At the festival, he attended many other events alongside of it, and although the crowds liked the impressive show of force, they were more interested in talking with their Emperor. The show of public support inspired Dark to travel more during the Festival. He has taken a great pleasure in doing so, and it is rumoured that he wants to make it a yearly occurence."
 fso.18.a:0 "The crowds, they love, they love me!"
 fso.19.t:0 "Potatoes and Bread"
 fso.19.d:0 "Being cheap products, the cooks managed to make and store lots and lots of bread and potatoes and feed a massive amount of people. The leaders of countries were also gorging on fine red and black caviar. The Soviet representatives especially were impressed with the sheer amount of bread and potatoes, and even asked if they could take a few tonnes home. Mao claimed he has never seen caviar before. Tannu Tuvan representatives, unfortunately, were forgotten about and had to be content with the same food as the crowds - however, nobody cared to notice. The diplomats seemed to have made a lot of time to meet the Plebeian Assembly members and the Tribune."
 fso.19.a:0 "They probably just shared some opinions."
 fso.20.t:0 "Sushi, Pizza and Sausages"
 fso.20.d:0 "Quality food made an excellent impression on all world leaders, however most impressed were the diplomats from Berlin, Tokyo and Rome. Emperor Darku, fascinated with Roman Empire just like the rulers of current Italy, conversed in Latin with the italian immediately appointed ambassador. Germany and soon after Japan appointed their ambassadors as well, and the rest of the world followed not long after the feast. Many words and promises of friendship of cooperation were exchanged, which visibly pleased the Officer Corps members present. Later they were quoting the Emperor on his comradery with the leading fascist powers."
 fso.20.a:0 "Germans, Italians and Japanese have a thing in common - good food!"
 fso.21.t:0 "Tea and Biscuits"
 fso.21.d:0 "A bit modest, but surely sweet, tea party held by the Friendship Order pleased the most attendees. Certainly, very much at home felt those from Britain, and the american diplomats politely supported their friends from London. Senators and diplomats talked a lot, and the latter shared a lot of wisdom and fun stories from their home parliaments. It seems that we have made a good impression on the inhabitants of Albion, as the news headlines would suggest on the following day."
 fso.21.a:0 "The Senate better not waste time on tea parties!"
 fso.22.t:0 "Praetorian Cooks"
 fso.22.d:0 "Definitely not the best choice, the Praetorians were not the greatest cooks! As such, the world leaders had to eat takeout ordered from the nearest restaurants. Luckily, the diplomats liked the presented food. To make the conference go smoother, the Emperor had decided to lead the diplomats to the restaurant closest to them. Such honour left the owners and personnel in awe, and later the word spread quickly about how close the Emperor is to the common business folk and working people."
 fso.22.a:0 "At least the world leaders were happy."
 fso.23.t:0 "Plebeian Police"
 fso.23.d:0 "The Assembly took the chance to solve this crime eagerly... perhaps, a little too eagerly. The appointed investigators brought their findings to Assembly, and the discussion that followed went well into the night. Finally, after a few days the Assembly and its investigation came to a conclusion: the senator was assassinated! In life he was a supporter of Tribune's rights, and as such the corrupt Consuls in the Senate could not allow him to live. They hired the killer, he threw the senator out the window, made it look like an accident... \"Just another act of violence by the oppressors in the Senate\", they claim. The Emperor was not blatantly blamed in their statement, however he was criticized for \"allowing\" this plot to go unnoticed. Both Senate Consuls resigned the following day, and are awaiting trial. The Assembly's popularity among the people is massively increased as a result."
 fso.23.a:0 "Suspicious..."
 fso.24.t:0 "Military Tribunal"
 fso.24.d:0 "The veterans' investigation proved to be thorough and dedicated. Upon completely inspecting the crime scene, talking to witnesses and analyzing clues, they reported to the Senate upon their findings. \"It is with a heavy heart we admit that he slipped on a slice of Di Giorno pizza and fell out the window\", they said. \"However, we have evidence to show that the slice was left there with malicious intent by a man hired by the Tribune himself!\" As this evidence they presented the money supposedly used to pay the man and the man himself - a sleazy looking fellow, who swore it was the Tribune who hired him to put the slice in the senator's room. The public is in shock. Tribune has immediately stepped down and was judged, the Assembly is furious, causing street riots over unjust accusations. The Emperor, realising the Guard alone is not going to be enough, calls on the Officer Corps to quell the riots. Military steps in and is regarded nationwide as saviours and keepers of Order."
 fso.24.a:0 "Well, their investigation seems legitimate..."
 fso.25.t:0 "The Senate's Investigation"
 fso.25.d:0 "Senatorial Board of Investigators - such is the official term for the team - is doing pretty much everything that the senators normally do - make a lot of speeches, give interviews, make a lot of noise, but they do not actually do a lot to solve the crime itself. \"It was most likely just an unfortunate accident\", the official statement reads. Whether or not this is actually the case, we might never find out. However, the Senate has gained significant influence with the leverage of this \"investigation\"."
 fso.25.a:0 "But what happened to the poor senator who died?!"
 fso.26.t:0 "Praetorian Investigation"
 fso.26.d:0 "Praetorians are trustworthy and competent, the Emperor considered. They conducted a thorough investigation of the event, the crime scene, interviewed all they could, but had to present a rather... Anticlimactic explanation. \"It appearts that he accidentally dropped a slice of Di Giorno pizza, and then slipped on it, which lead to him falling out the window\". Nothing happened as a result of investigation itself, but it would appear that the common folk is praising the Guard for their proffesionalism and express their belief that \"Praetorians keep us safe\"."
 fso.26.a:0 "They are to be trusted."
 fso.27.t:0 "The Question of Monarchy"
 fso.27.d:0 "Glory to the people! Our transition of Plebeian Assembly into power was a success. However, the Emperor Dark Buddhist still formally leads the country. He has observed our actions carefully, weighing us. Some factions in the Assembly call for his removal as monarchy is opposed by Marxist teachings, but others wisely argue that the Emperor holds a lot of influence over the people still as their beloved symbol of friendship. The arguments in the Assembly continued, until finally..."
 fso.27.a:0 "...The radical faction won the vote! Plan the assassination!"
 fso.27.b:0 "...The negotiatiors gain the upper hand! Send the delegates!"
 fso.28.t:0 "Death of the Emperor"
 fso.28.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. The Guards were overpowered by the sheer numbers and their resistance was neutralized by noon. The Emperor himself was captured in his bedroom, led out to the city square and executed under the chorus of bloodthirsty screams of the plebs. However, by the end of the day the conspirators were informed that Peetry, Emperor's brother, and the remaining Praetorians, accompanied by the remaining loyalists, fled to the south, where they gathered a potent force to \"liberate the nation from the murderous, fake news fagsies in the Assembly\". This marked the start of a civil war..."
 fso.28.a:0 "The people will prevail!"
 fso.29.t:0 "Ire of the People"
 fso.29.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. However, the Guards resistance was enough to hold off the attackers long enough for the Emperor and his loyalists to escape. After the word of this reached Praetorians defending the palace, they escaped the city as well, leaving the conspirators empty handed. The crowds grumble, and worries are raised in the Assembly, although many believe that Emperor's escape only further proves his guilt. The fire of the civil war is now burning..."
 fso.29.a:0 "We will emerge victorious!"
 fso.30.t:0 "Monarchy Destroyed"
 fso.30.d:0 "The murderers decided that the support of the people is enough to warrant a blunt approach without triggering a backlash. Rumours were spread that the Emperor plots to overthrow the rightfully established Assembly, and despite the Guard's and loyalists best efforts to thwart this, the belief was planted firmly. At dawn, the Palace was stormed by a massive amount of militia and the military. Caught off guard, the Praetorians were neutralized within an hour, and the Emperor captured, as well as most loyal leaders and his brother Peetry. Later that day the Emperor was executed, crowds mixed with cheering and grieving for the loss of their Emperor. The remaining loyalists have dispersed with no real centralised opposition; all minor groups were suppressed and eliminated shortly. It seems that the transition of power is now complete."
 fso.30.a:0 "All according to plan."
 fso.31.t:0 "The Grand Conference"
 fso.31.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. Eventually, the Emperor finally seemed to accept and see reason in the words of Assembly's finest demagogues. As a result, Dark was leaning more and more to a conclusion that the only way now for him to ensure the stability of this nation was to resign and distance himself from politics entirely, in seclusion away from the capital, surrounded by his loyal friends and supporters. While this was not quite what the negotiators had in mind, this was still an acceptable outcome to the question of monarchy, and enough to silence the more radical parties in the Assembly, and a popular option among the people, who saw the Emperor more as a formal ideal rather than a real force of power."
 fso.31.a:0 "We will keep an eye on him anyway, just in case."
 fso.32.t:0 "The Visionary Emperor"
 fso.32.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. Eventually, the Emperor finally seemed to accept and see reason in the words of Assembly's finest demagogues. He was becoming more and more agitated and invested, and it would appear as he had started forming ideas of his own. The discussions became arguments, and through Dark's immense charisma and logic, the mentors became enthralled more in his vision of communist ideas, which Dark himself called \"Cutie-Marxism\". Finally, Dark held a speech in the Plebeian Assembly, which was broadcast by the radio across the country. He proclaimed his vision of the world as a union of friendship socialist states, explained the basics of Cutie-Marxism, and finished by accepting the Assembly leaders' invitation to lead the country as the Supreme Leader. This day will truly go down in history."
 fso.32.a:0 "The dawn of a new era!"
 fso.33.t:0 "Creeping Fear"
 fso.33.d:0 "The negotiators launched a series of consultations with the Emperor, discussing the future of the Order with him personally and on the Assembly meetings. They were eager to discuss the teachings of Marx and Lenin with Dark Buddhist, and continually attempted to show him why they chose them. However, no matter how hard they tried, these just did not sit well with Dark Buddhist at all. Worse, the intensity and frequency of invitations, discussions and meetings led to him growing suspicious and cautious. Then came allegations of dishonesty, then malicious intent, then, finally, accusations of treason. The negotiators were desperate, but it was too late. They could not influence the Emperor. One fateful day, the Praetorians stormed the Plebeian Assembly mid-session on the orders of the Emperor and demanded its closure immediately. Shaken by this, negotiators lost the initiative, while the radical factions eagerly took this as an opportunity. Militias and loyal military divisions surrounded the Senate's former building and besieged it, however, the Guards simply vanished before the encirclement was complete. The Emperor himself was long gone from the palace, and in a speech held from a radio station on the south of the country called for all still loyal to his name to gather and rally under the banners of \"true friends\". The civil war is now inevitable..."
 fso.33.a:0 "We tried our very best."
 fso.34.t:0 "Interesting Times"
 fso.34.d:0 "War! Civil war rages in our country now, and both sides are vehemently opposing one another. Let the dice fly!"
 fso.34.a:0 "We, of course, will be the victors."
 fso.35.t:0 "The Unrest Is Over"
 fso.35.d:0 "We have emerged victorious in the war, and now is the time to rebuild."
 fso.35.a:0 "Vae Victis."
 fso.36.t:0 "Into the Home of the Revolution"
 fso.36.d:0 "In this tense, aggressive world, our nation needs allies. Fortunately for us, our Marxist teachings are somewhat spread, and a very powerful Soviet Union would be likely willing to ally with us. The Plebeian Assembly formed the delegation, and they are ready to initiate negotiations with Moscow."
 fso.36.a:0 "We will show Comrade Stalin our devotion to the Revolution."
 fso.37.t:0 "Delegation from Friendship Union"
 fso.37.d:0 "Today Moscow receives guests from the Central Europe, where recent developments have led to establishment of a new communist state. The diplomats from the \"Plebeian Assembly\" ask humbly to consider their membership in the Comintern. Surely, gaining an ally in the middle of Europe is beneficial and influential, however it may trigger aggression that we may not be ready for..."
 fso.37.a:0 "Communist friends? Of course!"
 fso.37.b:0 "We must focus on our own matters."
 fso.38.t:0 "Invitation to Comintern"
 fso.38.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations and conferences our diplomats were finally invited to attend the meeting of Comintern. At the meeting, Soviet representative spoke in favour of including us into the pact and offered diplomatic assistance in form of a military alliance. Rejoicing is heard among the people of the Friendship Union!"
 fso.38.a:0 "A toast for our Russian comrades!"
 fso.39.t:0 "Alliance Denied"
 fso.39.d:0 "Unfortunately, despite our diplomats' best efforts, Stalin and his leadership decided that helping us is too dangerous and puts Soviet Union into a forward position not necessarily welcomed by other European powers. As such, the delegation returns home empty-handed. The Plebeian Assembly's leader Ladifour in a speech held later that day announced creation of the \"Union of Friendly Socialist Republics\" as \"a home and refuge to all those refused by their alleged comrades\". Other countries paid little to no attention, however..."
 fso.39.a:0 "Our people's will is stronger on its own."
 fso.40.t:0 "Autonomous Revolution"
 fso.40.d:0 "Glory to the Supreme Leader! Our strong and mighty Union still needs friends in this world. We have two options available: the Plebeian Assembly calls for a delegation to Moscow in an attempt to establish close ties to Stalin and Comintern, while the Supreme Leader is a fond fan of Trotsky's ideas. What do we do?"
 fso.40.a:0 "We will choose comrade Stalin and Comintern!"
 fso.40.b:0 "We will choose comrade Trotsky and Permanent Revolution!"
 fso.41.t:0 "Delegation from Friendship Union"
 fso.41.d:0 "Today Moscow receives guests from the Central Europe, where recent developments have led to establishment of a new communist state. The diplomats from the \"Plebeian Assembly\" ask humbly to consider granting aid from Comintern. Surely, gaining an ally in the middle of Europe is beneficial and influential, however it may trigger aggression that we may not be ready for..."
 fso.41.a:0 "Communist friends? Of course!"
 fso.41.b:0 "We must focus on our own matters."
 fso.42.t:0 "Dobyvatel-Molotov Pact"
 fso.42.d:0 "After weeks of negotiations, our two great nations finally come up with an agreement that suits both nations' interests. It was ratified today by the Plebeian Assembly, Supreme Leader and comrade Stalin in a big meeting held in Prague. Comrade Dobyvatel signed the pact on one side and comrade Molotov on the other, offering mutual guarantees and defensive alliances, as well as a non-aggression pact. Celebrations were held in both capitals, and the world trembles."
 fso.42.a:0 "I knew we could count on Russians!"
 fso.43.t:0 "Moscow denies Friendship"
 fso.43.d:0 "Despite our best diplomatic efforts, Stalin did not agree to sign any pact that would suit us as well. It appears that we are alone in the world... for now."
 fso.43.a:0 "We will find better friends then."
 fso.44.t:0 "Trotsky Found"
 fso.44.tt:0 "We can now force government in other nations, as well as fabricate wargoals and declare war on other communists.\nHowever, we can no longer make puppets!"
 fso.44.d:0 "For months our agents seeked out Trotsky and tried to contact him. Finally, their efforts come to fruition, and today a plane brought the exiled politician to Prague. The Supreme Leader himself met him and invited to live in a big apartment in his Friendship Palace of the People, former Imperial Palace. Leon Trotsky seemed to be cautious and a bit suspicious, but eventually the Supreme Leader's attitude and security provided by the loyal military eased him up and he accepted the Supreme Leader's offer. A communique from Moscow demanded Trotsky's immediate exportation to Soviet Union for trial, but it was ignored by the Supreme Leader."
 fso.44.a:0 "Best Friends Forever!"
 fso.45.t:0 "Honouring Obligations"
 fso.45.d:0 "As per our new agreement we must guarantee independence of the Friendship Union."
 fso.45.a:0 "Stalin is a man of his word."
 fso.48.t:0 "Science Funding"
 fso.48.d:0 "Our prospering nation is overproducing! The excess goods are sold to our neighbours and comrades, and the state has made a profit. The surplus of funds was decided to spend on sciences, arts and sports funding, sciences being first on the list. It is up to our Supreme Leader to pick what do we spend the funds on..."
 fso.48.a:0 "Spend the funds on publishing my book to rival any other communist thinker!"
 fso.48.b:0 "To modernize, our nation needs a library, the biggest in the world!"
 fso.47.t:0 "The Great Library"
 fso.47.d:0 "The Great Library is complete, and all are in awe at the sight. Scientists and free thinkers from across the world are flocking to it, and research flourishes as a result."
 fso.47.a:0 "Excellent! Now if you do not mind, I'll spend my days there too."
 fso.46.t:0 "Cutie Capital"
 fso.46.d:0 "The book has been published! The money was spent to produce thousands of copies, and it has swept the minds of many. \"Every citizen needs to be allowed and supported in pursuit of his personal talents\", Supreme Leader writes, \"thus we must search for people's talents\"."
 fso.46.a:0 "Are we going to get any royalties?"
 fso.49.t:0 "Communist Culture"
 fso.49.d:0 "Next on the list are the fine arts. A new Art Excellence Committee has been formed and tracks the quality - and content - of all art created in our glorious nation. An effort is being made to help our populations' worldview transition to that of our Supreme Leader, and as we know, arts are the finest tools of mind conquering."
 fso.49.a:0 "To us, the cinema is a priority!"
 fso.50.t:0 "Fervent Plebs"
 fso.50.d:0 "The results of our arts funding campaign are astounding. Impressed and convinced in our great leader's vision, our people now realised how wrong the other leaders are. They seem to be more diligent and organised, which impacted our factories in a great way."
 fso.50.a:0 "The real Red Army!"
 fso.51.t:0 "Faster, Higher, Stronger!"
 fso.51.d:0 "Naturally, the fervor of our people has to be expressed. We are now investing a lot of resources into arranging various sports events, promoting healthy lifestyle, and our artists are helping in this regard quite a lot, providing posters and artworks."
 fso.51.a:0 "Communism empowers our people!"
 fso.52.t:0 "Fastest, Highest, Strongest"
 fso.52.d:0 "The campaign is paying dividends, and many more fresh recruits in excellent health condition flock to our conscription centers. Now our support is firm across the nation, and we can start our Crusade!"
 fso.52.a:0 "Elitest of elites!"
 fso.53.t:0 "Rebuilding Alone"

 fso.53.a:0 "We can trust no one, even other communists."
 fso.54.t:0 "Harsh Lessons"
 fso.54.d:0 "After weeks of hard labour, we are finally back in full force. We have rebuilt the factories and destroyed towns and the cities. Celebrations are held again for major holidays, and we can concentrate on immediate matters once more. Plus we have made significant advancements in our industrial technology, allowing us to repair easier in the future."
 fso.54.a:0 "We have to do everything ourselves."
 fso.55.t:0 "Comintern Aids Us"
 fso.55.d:0 "Our nation is ravaged by war, but we are not alone. We have to rebuild, but our new friends are helping us. With their assistance the progress is smooth and quick, and we are going to be fully restored soon."
 fso.55.a:0 "Comrades help other comrades!"
 fso.56.t:0 "Reconstructed"
 fso.56.d:0 "We have completed rebuilding, and we've asked to share some of their industrial technology with us - now we can repair more efficiently ourselves. However, the increasing Comintern influence in Europe is not unnoticed. The world community, whipped by the capitalists at helm, is imposing trade restrictions!"
 fso.56.a:0 "Curses!"
 fso.57.t:0 "Statue of the Supreme Leader"
 fso.57.d:0 "The people are quick to embrace the Supreme Leader as their ruler again, as he was loved by them before as well. An effort has been made by the commune of Prague to allow construction of a statue dedicated to Dark Buddhist. They asked him to let them know how big the statue must be built."
 fso.57.a:0 "Build a grand, magnificent statue!"
 fso.57.b:0 "Build a normal statue."
 fso.57.c:0 "Put a bust on a small pedestal."

 fso.58.d:0 "Our diplomats, currently in Moscow, report that after seeing the news about the new massive statue Stalin was very displeased. In frustration, he ordered a construction of an even larger statue, but the project was cancelled due to its costs. Stalin is, understandably, very unhappy with us."
 fso.58.a:0 "Ooof..."
 fso.59.t:0 "Comrade Stalin Approves"
 fso.59.d:0 "Reports from our diplomatic mission in Moscow suggest that comrade Stalin received the news about the statue with respect. He told one of the diplomats that \"moderation in all things is a key to success\" and complimented our great leader on his humbleness."
 fso.59.a:0 "Supreme Leader is a paragon of virtue!"
 fso.60.t:0 "Moscow Reacts"
 fso.60.d:0 "Our ambassadors in Soviet Union contacted us recently and suggested that they are being ridiculed, humiliated even. The Soviet leaders are more condescending than ever, but at least seem eager and willing to \"aid our little comrades in Europe\". What comes of this in the end remains to be seen."
 fso.60.a:0 "At least we are closer to being actual communists."
 fso.61.t:0 "Cast Alone"
 fso.61.d:0 "Our defensive industry effort was a success. New technological advancements and agitational propaganda among the workers ensures flexibility in our factories and we've stored a lot of spare parts in case of requiring repairs."
 fso.61.a:0 "We have to do everything ourselves."
 fso.62.t:0 "Comintern Aids Us"
 fso.62.d:0 "Soviet advisors have completed the inspection of our industrial capacity, and they provided our engineers with many useful insights into factory structuring and replaceable parts. We've gained a massive surplus of parts and equipment from Comintern, but this has seriously concerned other nations of the world."
 fso.62.a:0 "We do not need capitalist trade anyway."
 fso.63.t:0 "Outcasts"
 fso.63.d:0 "We are all alone. Isolated. \"Cutie-Marxism in one state\" is heard almost akin to a chant in the Plebeian Assembly, and people seem to be reflecting on this. The general opinion is that we, spurned by all, misunderstood by all, must forge our own path and close our country to the outside world."
 fso.63.a:0 "This is the way".
 fso.64.t:0 "Soviet Inspectors"
 fso.64.d:0 "A team of specialists from Moscow has arrived today to examine our factories and industry. They will serve here as advisors and help us gain a better understanding of improving our industrial power."
 fso.64.a:0 "Good, good!"
 fso.65.t:0 "Hopes for Tomorrow"
 fso.65.d:0 "Messengers with all sorts of pamphlets, manifestos and diplomatic offers left Prague this morning. The supreme leader himself visited the Plebeian Assembly and shared a toast to our newly found identity.\nThe people are joyful as well, seeing Assembly taking active role in legimizing our young communal nation. Nobody can tell, if diplomacy and relations will be enough, but hopeful spirit rules the day and at many places cheering turns to party."
 fso.65.a:0 "No party like a communist party."
 fso.66.t:0 "In the Dead of Night"
 fso.66.d:0 "Two months of silence were more then worrying. Not a single nation responded to our offers of friendly relations, yet the Assembly is keeping this fact from the public, for now. The supreme leader is often seen worried, looking from the palace window, obviously in a troubled state of mind.\nToday this would end. In the early morning hours, a secret delegation from Austria arrived to Prague and kindly asked to see the Supreme leader personally. Guards woke him up without hesitation and soon diplomats and Assembly representatives sat in a private room with their Austrian counterparts.\nSoon after, the Assembly rushed an early morning meeting and announced the news: some austrian politicians and prominent citizen ask us for a very bold move - to invade Austria and install our own government, in order to defend against the Reich together.* the * Delegation also argued, that we are but next in line, so cooperation only makes sense, but Germans already have way too much influence in Austria. A direct intervention is unavoidable, should we accept their offer. What should we do?"
 fso.66.a:0 "We need allies and they need us!"
 fso.66.b:0 "Risking a war with the Reich would be suicide."
 fso.66.tt2:0 "Picking this option will lead to us losing all guarantees.\n"
 fso.66.tt:0 "Germany will like us if we refuse. This can lead to further agreements later."
 fso.75.t:0 "A Day to Remember"
 fso.75.d:0 "Was there ever a more glorious sight? This morning, the Austrian parliament in Vienna got a fancy new look. The flags of the Friendship Union rolled out from the windows and our Cutie-Marxist Crusaders made sure to arrest every nazi sympathizer in the building. While the necessary work is being done and new people appointed, our sights are set towards the west - thats where the upcoming storm will come from, and it will come soon. 'Tis surely a glorious day, but there is no time to celebrate."
 fso.75.a:0 "We release the land as per our obligation."
 fso.75.b:0 "The new government can be trusted. We do not need to interfere."
 fso.75.c:0 "Welcome our new best comrades!"
 fso.67.t:0 "The Alpine Wall"
 fso.67.d:0 "Construction of a long line of defensive forts began today. All the way from Tyrol to Silesia, we are building together, Austrian, Czech and other workers as one, sharing resources and manpower. The Germans already addressed our newly formed friendship and made sure to make a few threatening speeches and are pressuring western powers to stay out of it. Would the Alps and mountains of the Sudeten be enough to keep the nazis out?"
 fso.67.a:0 "Death is preferable to being a Nazi subject."
 fso.68.t:0 "Defenses Are Ready!"
 fso.68.d:0 "Construction overseers came with some exciting news today: the whole defensive line is complete!\nFortification experts are still worried, though, pointing out that some areas are easier to push through than others and strongly suggested we consider building even better defenses at crucial spots across the borderline. \nMeanwhile, Austrian population is getting used to the new communist government and our Cutie-Marxist Crusaders are making sure that no bigger instability arises both at home and in Austria."
 fso.68.a:0 "Let them come."
 fso.69.t:0 "Unlikely Alliance?"
 fso.69.d:0 "With lots of effort and a little bit of ideological gymnastics, the Plebeian Assembly has managed to put together a proposal to the Germans, offering our support in their obvious upcoming political maneuvers, namely incorporating Austria into the Reich and supporting their claim on Danzig.\nOur finest diplomats are going to be sent today to Berlin, securing key relations with the Reichstag and making sure our own borders will stay secure."
 fso.69.a:0 "Will they accept?"
 fso.70.t:0 "Scratch My Back, I Scratch Yours"
 fso.70.d:0 "The long awaited response from the Reich has finally arrived. Current Tribune of the Plebeian Assembly, Ladifour, unsealed the letter in front of all plebeians, reading aloud the carefully worded acceptance of our proposal. The German Reich welcomed our support in their future endeavors and decided to sign a pact of non-aggression, promising to respect our national sovereignty as long as we support their moves.\nAfter the reading was done, a loud applause echoed the Assembly. Another victory for the Friendship Union!"
 fso.70.a:0 "Cunning diplomats, aren't we?"
 fso.70.tt:0 "Germany will now never Demand Sudetenland.\n\n"
 fso.71.t:0 "The Situation is Dire"

 fso.72.t1:0 "Out Of The Way"
 fso.72.t2:0 "Old Ties"
 fso.72.d1:0 "There is no way a free land can survive surrounded by bourgeoisie dictatorships.  Our commune is somewhat willing to take up arms and free the people of neighbouring nations, and the Assembly is about to pass the war planning order soon. Looking beyond the horizon, there is one ugly thing standing in our view - the nation of Hungary."
 fso.72.d2:0 "Most people alive still remember being one nation with hungarians, fighting the same wars, side by side, living together, speaking together, sharing common goals and common problems. Thanks to our common story, its not so hard to imagine being together once more, except this time as free folk and comrades!"
 fso.72.a:0 "Soon there will be no such obstacle."
 fso.72.b:0 "I hope they share some goulash."
 fso.73.t1:0 "Pest of Budapest"
 fso.73.t2:0 "Unbroken Promises"
 fso.73.d1:0 "Extensive landscape research was carried out, while a squadron of our slovakian spies scouted most of the northern cities of Hungary. Land owners and wealthy citizens of major cities are becoming worried, as nobody has fully pledged to protect them from the masses of enraged workers.\nPlans can be carried out whenever we wish. Workers are being silenced in this pitiful state, theres no other option than removing the ruling class by force."
 fso.73.d2:0 "Still bathing in glory and prestige, as we were the only ones to offer a helping hand to Austria while all the other big nations stood idle, The people of Hungary asked the same, and we obliged.\nThere was no real resistance from the upper classes, as the workers all across the country rose up and either let them surrender peacefully, or took them hostage. The last pockets of resistance still exist across the country, but rest of them were more than willing to put up a Friendship Order flag, when they saw the liberation army approaching."
 fso.73.a:0 "Together forever!"
 fso.73.b:0 "Blood for freedom!"
 fso.76.t:0 "The Cutie Speech"
 fso.76.d:0 "A passionate speech resonated both throughout the walls of the Assembly and within the hearts of all listeners. In utter silence, audience listened as if under a spell to the speech about an epic journey:\n\"How long will we hold the jewels of our newfound freedom just for ourselves and our kin? How long will we act like the Soviets, just waiting around, whilst lower classes suffer all around the globe? Comrades, I can't watch people being enslaved for work for their masters, being dehumanized to a level of mere cattle. My friends, it is time for us to strike at the heart of the corrupt machinery, and travel far, freeing all peoples on the way.\"\n\"I am a crusader, and a son of Marx. I say, one last war to end all wars! One last blood to save all! One last crusade, to connect all... So who's with me?!\" - shouted the Supreme Leader.\n\"I am a crusader!\" - yelled back, cutting through the silence, one of the plebeians. \"I am a crusader!\" - stood up another.\nAnd just like that, war fervour quickly spread all across Prague. The crusade is about to begin!"
 fso.77.t:0 "Cocked And Ready!"
 fso.77.d:0 "With the vanguard well armed and prepared, the rising sun is on the horizon. The finest creative minds of our lands put together revolutionary designs of cutie crusader tanks and vehicles, while tireless and enthusiastic workers assembled the machinery. Was there ever a more beautiful sight than all working together, in preparation for the last crusade to free them all?\n\"You must not forget who you are,\" urged the Tribune. \"Dont leave a scorched land behind as you go, free all the people, preserve their homes, their fields! If there is one enemy, it is the rich and powerful demagogues. As you capture those monsters, dear comrades, do not fall down to their level, preserve the newfound wealth from being stolen, ravaged and destroyed. Distribute it instead among the locals! If we are to ever build a fair, loving society, we must show the best of us and be the ultimate inspiration for the people.\nNow good luck crusaders, and do not forget your task!\""
 fso.77.a:0 "To arms!"

 fso.78.t:0 "Test of Time"
 fso.78.d:0 "It is one thing to take, to conquer, to burn down and destroy... and its entirely other thing to keep it all together.\nAs we seized the wealth and estates of the rich, except minor cases of theft and administration failures, it seems to be quite fairly redistributed with help of already existing structures. The ghost of war is still haunting the lands though, and the dust just barely settled. Victims and families of the fallen soldiers still endulge in passive or aggresive resistance and many functional errors occur everywhere.\nThe wisest of deciions has been made - to slow down, rebuild, nourish and integrate what weve already liberated."
 fso.78.a:0 "It is essential."
 fso.79.t:0 "A New Society"
 fso.79.d:0 "A single tear escaped the Supreme Leader's eye upon seeing the grand parade. People from all corners of our grand commune celebrating together, laughing, joking, feasting. Statues, public houses, schools and hospitals are rising all across the previously devastated lands and majority of the locals now see the light of communism. Now, they can finally live in peace, without the Damokles sword in shape of their former masters whips..."

They have been quiet. Too quiet.\" He paused, as if thinking about something. But not a few moments later, continued. \"Comrades, war with the russian bear is inevitable. There can be only one Union. But for now... for now we must secure our position firmly in Europe. Prepare our army, for the final act begins.\""

An official proclamation today from the Palace of Friendship states that we as a nation must fulfill our destiny and become the most powerful state in the world, and unify Europe under one banner, our banner.

 fso.82.d:0 "At last, our grip on Europe and beyond is unmatched. Our enemies lie in ruins, and our friends praise our leadership. People on the streets are chanting the supreme leader's name, women name their children after him, holidays are established on his birthday. Only one country so far has not been touched. One nation observed us from the side. One corrupt government. One failed state. A failed communist society, rotten to the core. We simply must intervene, We must save the suffering workers and farmers of the Soviet Union! Only a full conquest shall satisfy us!"

The supreme leader declared an amnesty to all purge victims and those prosecuted by the old regime... replacing them in camps with supporters of Stalin.\nWe are now victorious, and our Cutie Crusade is complete!\n\nThis is the end of this story. Thank you for playing it to the end! You have officially won :D\nNow you can either continue playing this game and bring the world to knees or try a different path or branch - after all, there are many options and outcomes to try, and every game will be different as the Friendship Order!"

 fso.84.t:0 "A Peace Offer!"
 fso.84.d:0 "After a long series of offensive maneuvers we have finally overpowered the Allied forces in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine, as well as any of their aligned states. Our warpath all the way from our home in Prague to the hot deserts of Middle East is a shock to them, an unexpected, stunning defeat. Realising that they will not be gaining back any lost ground now as we have firmly garrisoned it, the envoys from London and Paris today arrived to see the supreme leader and negotiate peace. Together they worked out acceptable peace terms: end to all hostilities in return to our forces keeping our conquest, as well as promises of no further influence in the Middle East."
 fso.84.dd:0 "France only had a small garrison in Syria, and our army has pushed them out quickly. Without British support, there is no hope for France to ever reclaim these colonies. As such, the diplomats from Paris have today agreed with our supreme leader's peace terms: end of hostilities, transfer of Syria to us and no further influence in the Middle East."
 fso.84.ddd:0 "Without France and its large army, British could not defend all of their stretched out empire. Our troops have secured Palestine and Jordan, and firmly hold off any naval invasions or attacks. London has sent us an envoy with a peace agreement: British Empire will transfer the colonies to us and leave the Middle East with promises of no further influence in there."

 fso.85.d:0 "The long war in Europe, one of many, has subsided for now. All continental enemies capitulated, but still there are enemies across oceans of land and water. Realising that Europe is lost completely, they have sent us envoys with a peace treaty: they are willing to sign a separate peace and allow us to annex the europeans."
 fso.85.a:0 "They betray their allies?"
 fso.86.t:0 "Securing Our Future"
 fso.86.d:0 "Despite insurance provided by Comintern, our position as Germany's next door neighbour remains unstable. Germans in Sudetenland are almost up in arms, and they openly oppose our rule. It will not be long before this is used as a pretext for invasion by Germany... However, with massive economic support provided by Comintern we have come up with a plan - and the Germans will definitely help us with it too!.."
 fso.86.a:0 "It is a genius idea."
 fso.87.t:0 "Generallplan Czechia"
 fso.87.d:0 "The plan was executed perfectly. First, necessary negotiations were initiated in Munich. Delegates from London, Berlin and Moscow met and discussed the Sudetenland situation. What came out of it publicly was the Munich Diktat. However, in secret, the Germans, Russians and the British all agreed to help perform a daring scheme, nicknamed in Germany \"Generallplan Czechia\".\n\nOver the following months, hundreds of convoys filled with people sailed across the Atlantic Ocean, south, to Falklands, and then Argentina and Chile. Pressured by all three major power blocs, Argentina and Chile both simply followed the lead and were helpless as millions of Czechs populated the southern territories. Finally, the last of them have now crossed the ocean, bringing the might of the Friendship Order's Army, which secured Buenos Aires. Germany in the meantime secured the now deserted, empty Czechoslovakia, administrating the lands as they please.\n\nThe Plebeian Assembly now convenes in Argentina's former Parliament, and its government has fled northwards. The first edict of the Assembly on the new spot was renaming Buenos Aires to Nova Praha, and the city commune has been tasked with renaming every street now.\n\nThe United States, a major power so far playing by the rules of Monroe Doctrine, was most displeased, and the Congress is now in full opposition towards the United Kingdom. [USA.GetLeader] stated that \"caving in to the Germans is the likely thing the dying Empire would do.\" They are not likely to simply leave us alone."

 fso.90.d:0 "Over five million argentinians now end up living with us, under our rule, just like Slovakians used to be once. However, where once we were limited by being in the center of the world's attention, now we are remote and can practically do as we please... To a degree. Things do not have to be grim, however - we can always use more numbers, and Argentinians may prove to be useful allies should be convince them to join the right cause."

 fso.91.d1:0 "Over the past two months, a series of purges occured in and around former Buenos Aires. Thousands of argentinian families were executed, lynch mobs burned, raped and pillaged, and so did the soldiers of our army. But that was merely the first step of \"Buenos Noches\", as this operation was called by our ideologists. The remaining Argentinian population under our rule was arrested and directed into work camps, where they were meant to die from excruciating and harsh work conditions, including but not limited to: barely any food, 12 hour work days, hard labour in quarries and mines, disregard of safety conditions for Argentinians, and so on. The \"enemies of the Friendship Union\" was the official label of these people.\nAlmost religious fervour inspired in our non-Argentinian populace, caused by this avalanche of violence, has unified them and our government's military actions find a lot more support now that the blood is spilled.\nHowever, not all Argentinians were purged. Some of them managed to slip away from the country, and our gruesome genocide is now widely known. Argentinian government in exile has closed all diplomatic relations, and our trade with almost all of the remaining world is limited."
 fso.91.d2:0 "A series of laws were passed by the Assembly, granting various rights and priviliges to our Argentinian population. Within these past months, our society took a friendly approach towards them, and they now seem eager to be a core part of our armed forces. This will definitely cause more sympathizers to join our armies as we progress, but will make it easier for spies and saboteurs to infiltrate our ranks."

Immediately after the prepared agents in the crowd shouted and blamed the police nearby. Then, the communist militia disguised in the crowd started attacking the officers of the police, and as the police responded, in the chaos more people were shot. This infuriated the crowds, and they joined the militias, overwhelming the police. Brazilian government was forced to call upon the military, and they made just the mistake our contacts were anticipating: the hardline military commanders ordered fire against the mutinous crowds.\nThousands of innocents, caught in the line of fire, died on this day, and the communist militiamen among them knew they would die for the right cause. This became "The Red Carnival", an event that will go down in history as one of the bloodiest war crimes.\nThe fire of the civil war now burns in Brazil.

 fso.103.t:0 "The True Enemy"
 fso.103.d:0 "At last, we have secured the entire continent. The United States are shaking in their boots. In their anger, they do not know how to stop us. Today, the american army marched into Canada and a coup in Mexico overthrew the government, immediately requesting \"protection from the imminent communist threat\". The entire North American continent is now unified against the entire South American continent. North vs South again. And the South is going to win this time."

 fso.104.d:0 "As was expected, we are victorious. The United States lie in ruins, and the communists who spent their lives in hiding from the federal government are now appointed to the new offices in our unified nation. Perhaps, we should consider adopting a new state structure?"
 fso.104.a:0 "United Soviet Socialist America? Sounds brilliant."
 fso.105.t:0 "A Statue Project"
 fso.105.d:0 "We are now in full control of Rio. The Plebeian Assembly pointed out the fact that the city houses one of the largest religious statues ever built - statue of Christ the Redemptor. It is an insult to our communist ways, and a faction of the Assembly wants us to dismantle it. A team of sculptors already proposed to use the materials gained in this way to build the Statue of Equality - a symbol of our supremacy, to rival the american statue of liberty in New York. The project now only awaits to be approved."
 fso.105.a:0 "You may fire when ready."
 fso.106.t:0 "The Church of Revolution"
 fso.106.d:0 "A group within our nation is gaining power rapidly. It is calling itself the Church of Holy Revolution, and it is gaining followers very rapidly. They have proclaimed Rio de Janeiro their holy site, and the city has grown to rival Nova Praha in influence because of them. Their teachings attract many as the early Christianity attracted people in the Roman Empire, promising social equality, peace, harmony and calling for the world revolution. While religions are against the communist teachings, we cannot deny the influence and power of this newfound cult. Perhaps it can be used as an instrument?"

 fso.107.t:0 "The Church Seizes Power!"
 fso.107.d:0 "It seems that by trusting the religious snakes we simply allowed them to take the leadership from the Assembly. They have been appointing loyal, devoted commissars on important official posts for a long time now, and now they have come as far as officially overthrow us! Now the Church Committee observes all aspects of our nation."
 fso.107.a:0 "If God exists, may he help us all!"
 fso.108.t:0 "Mass Suicide!"
 fso.108.d:0 "Our continued suppression of the Church has had a positive (for us) effect! A few days ago the last few thousands of their followers have left Rio today, presumably towards the northern jungle in former French Guyana, and committed mass suicide there."
 fso.108.a:0 "Good riddance!"
 fso.109.t:0 "The Church Revolts!"
 fso.109.d:0 "Our continued suppression of the Church, it seems, have made them only stronger - and angrier! They number of followers continued to grow, and many in the military have been secretly sharing their beliefs, it seems, as today a part of our armed force declared that they will now fight for the Holy Church Committee! They seized important key structures and demand the Plebeian Assembly to turn over full control of the nation."
 fso.109.a:0 "They can try and take it."

 fso.111.t:0 "National Defense Act"
 fso.111.d:0 "A few weeks have passed, and the depression phase has passed, giving room to acceptance and hate towards the \"foreigners\" - anyone who lives in another country has abandoned us, they must hate us, they must be our enemies! Surely, they plot to attack us in the future...\nThe Plebeian Assembly decides to act preemptively, closing our borders as part of the National Defense Act. Effectively, starting today, our nation is in a permanent state of undeclared war."
 fso.111.a:0 "The whole world is out for us!"
 fso.112.t:0 "Invisible Enemy"
 fso.112.d:0 "We can close our borders, but we cannot close air itself - and our enemies will certainly listen in to our radio transmissions, as well as pollute it with their own waves. We will put in all of our efforts to create a code no one can ever crack!"

 fso.113.t:0 "The Friendship Code"
 fso.113.d:0 "Our investment paid off trememndously. Our spies report that the foreign governments are confused and concerned as they can no longer understand anything from our transmissions using the new code developed. We also developed an interesting system of \"radar\" that will allow us to not relying on spies anymore at all in a not so distant future."
 fso.113.a:0 "We cannot send our own people to the hostile world."
 fso.114.t:0 "Great Wall of Czechia"
 fso.114.d:0 "The people are growing increasingly concerned with our safety from the outside world. The Plebeian Assembly has thus approved a grand project to fortify our borders, preventing any intrusion. Also planned are extensive and intricate anti-air systems, reducing effectiveness of any airborne bombardment, and the state-of-the-art radar systems are to be installed across the country, perfecting our detection protocols."
 fso.114.a:0 "We need to build the wall!"
 fso.115.t:0 "Every Man A Foe"
 fso.115.d:0 "The defense system is complete! a massive line of fortifications, trenches, pillboxes, bunkers and a lot of underground tunnels, all interconnected and spanning the entire length of the country, is certain to defend us against any and all threats from the outsiders. Anti-air points are covering the country, connected to the system of fortifications and allowing to effectively preventing any bombers from getting within reach.\nRadar stations are positioned around the nation, connected and linked to one massive computing device in Praha. There, it is located in the High Command military bunker, allowing our officers to observe actions of our neighbours and detecting troop movements.\nAll of our citizens were involved in this construction project, and when it was finally finished celebrations sparked all across the Union."
 fso.115.a:0 "They are right to celebrate, but we need to stay vigilant."
 fso.116.t:0 "People's Army"
 fso.116.d:0 "A slight problem has revealed itself in that we are lacking in the number of troops to man the borders of our nation. They are also not sufficiently prepared to defend, still reliant on our old doctrines where the words \"offensive\" and \"assault\" were still present. In our new nation, our army has to defend, not attack. We must rectify this - and agitate more people to join the army."
 fso.116.a:0 "We must protect ourselves."
 fso.117.t:0 "Aegis of Unity"
 fso.117.d:0 "After weeks of extensive planning, our Military Staff have come up with new doctrines, where defense is prioritised over offense, both defense of our borders and defense of our ideology. Commissars are to be established in each battallion, ensuring loyalty and providing a morale boost to defending soldiers. Offensive tactics were deemed unnecessary and redundant. We also managed to get some more people to sign up for the army."
 fso.117.a:0 "They must be ready to throw their lives at the enemy, if necessary."
 fso.118.t:0 "Industrial Might"
 fso.118.d:0 "As other countries denounced us and severed our trade, we must find a way to sustain ourselves without them. This will be a two stage plan. First, we must develop our industry and methods - we will ask our people once more to work hard and create factories which will be used to make weapons and equipment for our defense."
 fso.118.a:0 "1 year plan in a couple months?"
 fso.119.t:0 "Factories Of The People"
 fso.119.d:0 "A little miracle was achieved by our people as we have constructed great factories and roads to them. Our brilliant engineers have crafted wondrous new manufactoring and excavation technology, which ties in perfectly with our next step of the plan."
 fso.119.a:0 "The factories are welcome."
 fso.120.t:0 "Riches Of Our Soil"
 fso.120.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is already fairly rich in resources - not as much as our other European neighbours. However, our prospectors for a long time suggested that the planetary crust beneath our feet is even richer in resources, we simply lacked the technology to drill deep - until now. Massive monstrous drills are now in our posession, and we are ready to take the treasures of mother Earth."
 fso.120.a:0 "Burrowed deep, will soon be ours!"
 fso.121.t:0 "Crusty Resources"
 fso.121.d:0 "For months we were digging and drilling, creating an unmatched mines network the world has never seen before. Underground, deep below, we discovered rich deposits of steel, tungsten, chromium, ready to be delivered to our factories and fuel our war machine. However, an unexpected discovery occured. The suspicions arose when our miners started falling ill after working in the shaft 65-B. A team of prospectors in protective gear was sent out, and they returned with the report that we have stumbled in on a vein of Uranium. This element has been barely studied and other governments found it for the most part rather useless, but some of our researchers claim to have a... radical application in mind."
 fso.121.a:0 "If it can help us defend, we must use it."
 fso.121.tt:0 "We discovered Uranium.\n"
 fso.122.t:0 "Element of Harmony"
 fso.122.d:0 "Now that we have access to Uranium (or as the media have come to call it, the \"Element of Harmony\"), we can allow our researchers to properly stufy its effects. This is gonna take a long time, however..."
 fso.122.a:0 "We have a lot of time."
 fso.123.t:0 "Atomic Theory"
 fso.123.d:0 "The first few months already bear fruit. Our theoretical scientists have finalised something they refer to as \"the atomic theory\". Something about how all matter consists of tiny particles that are indivisible and not seen by any means except scientific detection... What matters is that they claim Element of Harmony may be the key to unlocking some kind of \"power within\" the atoms. We will see."
 fso.123.a:0 "Are we certain the money is well spent on them?"
 fso.124.t:0 "A Power Source"
 fso.124.d:0 "Any scientific theory must be proved in practice, and now our glorious engineers have created what some would consider impossible - an entirely new source of power, a \"nuclear reactor\". This top secret facility now provides power to our military infrastructure and the scientists claim that this is not the end of the possible applications."
 fso.124.a:0 "If it can create electricity, it can be used as a weapon?"
 fso.125.t:0 "How I Learned To Stop Worrying"
 fso.125.d:0 "And love the bomb! The engineers behind the marvellous new reactor have devised an explosive that used volatile uranium to unleash an immense chain reaction, causing an explosion of immense proportions - in theory. The device is not properly tested, but the Assembly has decided to link the launch pad for the rocket used to deliver the explosive to the High Command bunker. However, it seems that we have expended our resources on creating this device. To create another bomb like that we will need to use the reactor to \"activate\" more uranium."
 fso.125.a:0 "Now we can truly defend ourselves!"
 fso.125.tt:0 "We have made a prototype nuke.\n"
 fso.126.t:0 "New Dawn For Us"
 fso.126.d:0 "Our people feel safe now. Safe and protected from the outsiders. The news of our new weapon using \"Element of Harmony\" has inspired many to enlist and sign for the military. We will form an elite corps of \"Elements of Harmony\" - devoted to the cause and to defense of our motherland."
 fso.126.a:0 "Elements of Harmony... I like the sound of that!"
 fso.127.t:0 "Dream of Unity"
 fso.127.d:0 "A new era is upon us. Something great is bound to happen, our nation is destined for it. But danger looms on the horizon, and it appears that our enemies are on the move. They hear about the element of harmony, and they tremble. Our new army is ready to take their attack!"
 fso.127.a:0 "For the Union!"
 fso.127.tt:0 "Will create 24 divisions - the corps of elites."
 fso.128.t:0 "Act Of Aggression"
 fso.128.d:0 "Today, at 08:37 in the morning, our radar system has detected an incoming massive attack force. The alarm went off, but the officer staff needs time to assemble, and the invasion force was threatening to breach our defense line and strike Praha if the decision was not made immediately. The officer on duty faced a difficult choice, but his ideological training took over. All outsiders are our mortal enemies, and they must perish. With that thought, he launched the prototype nuke at the massive enemy group detected by the radars. In less than half an hour, the threat vanished from the screens as fast as it appeared. Mission accomplished."
 fso.128.a:0 "We defended ourselves."

 fso.129.t:0 "European Defense Board Declares War"
 fso.129.d:0 "Our enemies outside are clearly scared of us. They used the media to play off as if the nuclear attack was directed at civilians and not in self defense. The dark clouds are gathering, and the enemy musters their forces. European wars have subsided, and the leaders have agreed to combine their military command under one entity, European Defense Board. The British Chancellor was elected the Board's leader, and we have received a formal declaration of war this morning."

 fso.130.t:0 "Bloodshed Carries A Price"
 fso.130.d:0 "For many long years we have fought. Our stoicism is admirable, and our troops stand firm. However, advancing into the enemy territory is proving to be impossible. Both sides are realising the pointless waste of life. The negotiations of a white peace are offered by the European Defense Board. They agree to demilitarize the border with our nation and do not pursue us any further so long as we do not use our nuclear armaments."
 fso.130.a:0 "These are acceptable terms, they better stay away."

 fso.131.t:0 "Glorious Victory"
 fso.131.d:0 "Against all possible odds, despite the numerical advantage of our enemy, we reign supreme, and the opposing forces have surrendered unconditionally.

 fso.132.t:0 "Albert Einstein"
 fso.132.d:0 "Our Military Intelligence reports that a foreign scientist, Albert Einstein, can help us a lot in understanding the applications of Element of Harmony... but he needs to be persuaded first. Our special operations crew has developed a plan to kidnap him for further indoctrination - shall we try it?"
 fso.132.a:0 "Yes, of course."
 fso.132.b:0 "We do not need foreign \"scientists\"."
 fso.133.t:0 "Successful Operation"
 fso.133.d:0 "The kidnapping was performed just as planned, and Albert Einstein was taken from the United States. A couple of weeks in detention in our Military Intelligence headquarters was enough to convince him to help our research efforts. With his help we can boost all of our research, and we have already found a useful application of depleted uranium in our cannon rounds for more impact strength."
 fso.133.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.134.t:0 "Failed Kidnapping"
 fso.134.d:0 "Unfortunately, the CIA discovered our agents, and Albert Einstein was extracted into safety, and our american cell was compromised. This is a hit to our prestige, and prestige of our Intelligence."
 fso.134.a:0 "Oof."

 fso.136.d:0 "Despite the recent triumph of Dark and his loyalists, a sense of doubt and uncertainty has not abandoned him. The court gossips about the Emperor's moody attitude, and it seems often as if he is lost in thought. Those closer to Dark, however, know more. They are aware of what he told them, that he is not happy with the world as it is, uncertain of the direction he needs to take the country in, the people. \"Marxists, Nazis, Liberals, Conservatives, Centrists... none of them really hold true values\", he says.\nFinally, one day Dark has decided to go on a pilgrimage to the mountains, alone, to meditate and decide what truly matters in this world."
 fso.136.a:0 "May his journey bring him wisdom he seeks."
 fso.137.t:0 "The Emperor's New Clothes"
 fso.137.d:0 "Today the Emperor Dark Buddhist returns to the capital. He brings an entirely new concept of society and a new direction for the people and his nation. \"Friendshipism\", as he calls it, is an ideology that promotes friendship and kindness, balance and stability above all else. This idea is spreading quickly among the courtiers and the people alike, as it appeals to many as the one true way. The goal is clear now - we must dismantle all factions, disarm all armies, pacify all tyrants and greedy bankers, stop war and make eternal Pax Amicitiae!"
 fso.137.a:0 "Ave Caesar!"
 fso.138.t:0 "Whip or Tribute?"
 fso.138.d:0 "One of the important dilemmas Dark Buddhist encountered on his spiritual journey was the approach towards others his new ideology will take. Will it be aggressively poised against other ideologies? Or will we strive for a more peaceful approach? After long considerations, Dark Buddhist decides that..."
 fso.138.a:0 "...we live and let live."
 fso.138.b:0 "...we need better whips."
 fso.139.t:0 "Many or One?"
 fso.139.d:0 "The second dilemma Dark Buddhist faced had to do with the internal approach to society. What matters more - the common friendship of many, or the individuals in friendships? It is a very difficult choice, and both have advantages. After long considerations, Dark Buddhist decides that..."
 fso.139.a:0 "...the greater friendship matters more."
 fso.139.b:0 "...the individual friendships matter more."
 fso.140.t:0 "The Grand Embassy"
 fso.140.d:0 "One must never stop learning. It is a great wisdom for every person, and it’s twice as important for any leader. Our newly established emperor seems to be taking this life lesson quite seriously. After spending a few days alone, occasionally seen staring out of the window, he made a public announcement. Inspired by great people of the past, like Peter the Great, he too is going to travel the world, West and East, see what they do better, see what they believe in, and observe what they are best at. Let us hope it will be enough to be able to compete on the world’s stage in the future."
 fso.140.a:0 "We must stay competitive!"
 fso.141.t:0 "Return Home"

 fso.146.d:0 "And they say Germans do not party! First destination of our enlightening travels were of course our direct neighbour, the Empire of Germany, or how they like to call it, reich. Early this morning, the emperor and his most trusted friends arrived in Dresden. After a short visit, the still unofficial, sort of hidden delegation sent letters to the government, announcing their intention of visiting Berlin.\nThe Führer accepted our proposal of an official visit, with a possibility of knowledge exchange, with unforeseen eagerness. The asociated officials showed us into the factories of Volkswagen in Berlin, showing us some of their incredible technologies. Soon, all people would ride in cars, they said! We also got to see their ingenious engineers working on all sorts of impressive endeavours, including the military innovations.\nOur emperor was also excited to visit Metzingen in southern Germany, where the Hugo Boss company designed both super fancy coat and uniform for the emperor and all companions alike. Maybe they can provide the hottest uniforms for our homeland security!\nWe also had the honor of attending one of the legendary speeches of the Führer himself, and we made sure to take notes. Not that we share his ideas or goals, but we sure got a lot to learn about passionate speeches, about the whole art of persuading the audience and proper rhetoric."

 fso.309.d:0 "Before our historical road trip moved to Italy, we made sure to make a quick detour to the land of Napoleon. As nobody admires the grand reformer and military genius more than our own emperor of friendship, it was an inevitable call.\nFirst stop was the famous work of construction just behind the borders with Germany, the Maginot line. As the French officials welcomed our expedition, they proceeded to ask slightly unpleasant questions about our stay in Germany and clearly wanted to make sure there is no military alliance going on.\nAs we assured them the goals of our mission – making the Friendship order the beacon of great and free life – they finally allowed us to see some of the border bunkers and military installations. As magnificent it was, we had to move quickly and lose no time.\nBy far less impressive was the overall atmosphere and lack of military preparedness of the main military force. Lots of raw and untrained, often too young recruits sitting around the barracks, morale at the historical low point… and the unstable government isn’t really helping, although the French commune supporters surprised us with very interesting ideas and conversations. For us, it can be a valuable lesson to put away our internal differences and prepare for bigger external struggles.\nBy the end of our visit, one of the royal guards suggested we could attend or at least witness the biking contest Tour de France, and maybe find inspiration there. Do we have the time though?"

First stop Genoa, next stop Milano!\nWe had to contain ourselves though and move steadily towards meeting Mussolini’s officials, as well to see the factories of Fiat and impressive Italian fleet in the harbors. Still nobody could resist tasting the utmost amazing local cuisine and more than one voice claimed that we should import some of the cooks and chefs into Friendship Order.\nMussolini himself was an interesting company to be with. We’ve got to experience the fencing, we talked about social implications of some modern tendencies of both western democracies and Nazi Germany and all of us get to admire some of the beautiful remnants of ancient times within Rome itself. This particular stop felt more like vacation than official business.\nIt is time to move on again, and try to learn as much as we can, maybe bring something with us. What would it be?"

 fso.147.t:0 "Paint It Red, Tovarisch!"
 fso.147.d:0 "The final stop is by far the biggest one. Little did we know, arriving to our last destination before home would take half of the overall trip time. Going from Vladivostok to Moscow by train was surely an interesting experience. Seemingly never-ending wilderness for days is something you don’t see anymore!\nThe Moscow experience was something entirely different, though. Soviet delegation gave the word suspicious a whole new layer of meaning. At the same time, they went into great lengths to show us how amazing USSR and its capital are. Although we were able to move around freely with our hosts, the feeling of being watched and being more hostages than visitors never left.\nStalin did agree to meet us though, and after just several minutes in his office, we knew we are actually going to be safe. Not knowing about our previous endeavours, it seemed that he felt we are going to lean eastward and maybe join the Soviets in the future, or at least consider this route for the Friendship Order.\nWith this, the experience turned for the better again and Moscow turned into a never ending party. The best part of course was partying with the general staff. We knew they called themselves comrades, but we didn’t know they party like besties, despite the grim past and uncertain present!\nThinking about the newly rising USSR, it seems like the only cure for their stability was purging off any democratic, fascist or monarchist influence. Although that is unacceptable for the ways of Friendship, maybe we can adopt some of its ideas, to certain degree?"

Our delegation was met with polite, yet serious American counterpart, obviously suspicious of our intentions. Luckily, as we hit the road, the tension slowly weakened and upon arriving to New York City was entirely gone. We were already indulged in friendly chatter.\nPresident Roosevelt agreed to meet the emperor and made sure to note his displeased attitude towards extremism rising all across Europe. We were quick to assure him of one thing – the land of Bohemia is and will continue to be a beacon of liberty in heart of otherwise darkening old continent.\nUnited States cannot hide their huge economic depression, though. Despite the tales from home, fully functional factories with all the resources they need are just sitting idly, lay abandoned while people are losing homes and desperately trying to find a job. All of this because of avoidable stock market crash.\nThere are multiple lessons to be taught here. These people are fiercely proud of their national identity, yet care not about ones ethnicity. They are taking that pride a bit too far. Their scientific progress is nevertheless staggering and all of this potential just waits to awaken anytime soon. What should we learn from them?"

Now that he has returned, he wants to make a decision about doing the purges - decide the scale or if the purges are needed at all. Surely, the enemies of friendship must be removed, per say, but is it really aligned with friendshipism?.."
 fso.151.a:0 "Purge all edgelords! Everyone!"
 fso.151.b:0 "Perhaps we can only punish the most dangerous ones."
 fso.151.c:0 "I... I cannot do this."
 fso.152.t:0 "Save Target"
 fso.152.d:0 "Nobody will see this text anyway so I'll say it here: I like Hawaiian pizza."
 fso.152.a:0 "It's the best."
 fso.153.t:0 "Friendship Ruined"
 fso.153.d1:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Stalin have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Moscow is now closed to us, and we'll have no Stalin's support if we want Soviets to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d2:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Hitler have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Berlin is now closed to us, and we'll have no Hitler's support if we want Germans to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d3:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Mussolini have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Rome is now closed to us, and we'll have no Mussolini's support if we want Italians to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d4:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Roosevelt have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Washington is now closed to us, and we'll have no Roosevelt's support if we want Americans to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.d5:0 "Unfortunately, our efforts to befriend Hirohito have failed as he's gotten upset with our actions. Tokyo is now closed to us, and we'll have no Hirohito's support if we want Japanese to turn friendshipist."
 fso.153.a:0 "Oof"
 fso.154.t:0 "A Dinner For Two"
 fso.154.d:0 "Dark Buddhist already sent a letter to Berlin inviting Adolf Hitler for a dinner together. It would be a lovely meeting of friends, but the choice of foods is on the inviting side, that being us. What dishes shall we pick for the Fuhrer?"
 fso.154.a:0 "Baked potatoes with a side of pasta and cake dessert!"
 fso.154.b:0 "Fish and chips, with ice cream dessert!"
 fso.154.c:0 "Pierogi, sauerkraut and jelly dessert!"
 fso.154.dd:0 "Pork beef with a side of porridge and cupcakes!"
 fso.155.t:0 "A Happy Meal"
 fso.155.d:0 "It seems that our choice of foods pleased the Fuhrer greatly, as he was rather happy that we took the time to learn his food preferences. The dinner went very well, and we've made significant progress."
 fso.155.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.155.tt:0 "We made progress on becoming close friends."
 fso.156.t:0 "It Went Fine"
 fso.156.d:0 "These three words can describe the dinner very well. Despite not the best choice, the Fuhrer enjoyed the food and the conversation. We've made some progress."
 fso.156.a:0 "Good."
 fso.156.tt:0 "We are becoming friends."
 fso.157.t:0 "It Went Fine"
 fso.157.d:0 "These three words can describe the dinner very well. Despite not the best choice, the Fuhrer enjoyed the food and the conversation. We've made some progress."
 fso.157.a:0 "Good."
 fso.157.tt:0 "We are becoming friends."
 fso.158.t:0 "A Disaster!"
 fso.158.d:0 "The Fuhrer was furious when he saw the dishes presented to him. He was very mispleased to be offered meat, and nothing would cheer him up for the rest of the evening. He seems to dislike us more."
 fso.158.a:0 "A sad day."
 fso.158.tt:0 "We caused distrust! Be careful!"
 fso.159.t:0 "Downtown Berlin"
 fso.159.d:0 "Dark and Adolf were having a nice stroll along the streets of Berlin, planning to visit Hitler's favourite movie theater. However when they arrived it appears that the cinema is closed today! What shall we do?"
 fso.159.a:0 "Why not watch dog fights?"
 fso.159.b:0 "Go watch birds."
 fso.159.c:0 "Go to the park and paint."
 fso.159.dd:0 "Go see hot Hitlerjugend girls ;)"
 fso.160.t:0 "Distasteful"
 fso.160.d:0 "Hitler was seemingly upset when you offered him this idea, as he despised the idea of watching dog fights. The following argument ruined the mood and Hitler left in anger."
 fso.160.a:0 "Ahh..."
 fso.161.t:0 "Pretty Birds"
 fso.161.d:0 "You went to the park to watch the birds. Hitler fed the ducks in the pond also. It was all in all a good day."
 fso.161.a:0 "We made a little progress."
 fso.162.t:0 "Old Habits Die Hard"
 fso.162.d:0 "Hitler was very excited to dust off his painting skills and gladly accepted. The day flew by as you painted a park view together. It was a lot of fun."
 fso.162.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.163.t:0 "Hitlerjugend Girls"
 fso.163.d:0 "Hitler was quite proud to see the pretty aryan girls parading in front of him, and you peeked them a bit together in the changing room. Perverts! But it was fun nonetheless."
 fso.163.a:0 "He still loves Eva Braun tho."
 fso.164.t:0 "Weekend in the Alps"
 fso.164.d:0 "Dark and Adolf plan a weekend together, but are not quite certain what to do while they are there. There is a wide range of options and so little time!.."
 fso.164.a:0 "Let's just go skiing!"
 fso.164.b:0 "Propose Switzerland instead."
 fso.164.c:0 "Double date, Hitler with Eva and Dark with a pretty girl!"
 fso.164.dd:0 "Visit Linz, the place of youth."
 fso.165.t:0 "Skiing in the Alps"
 fso.165.d:0 "Dark and Hitler had a good weekend skiing in the mountainous Tyrol. Fond memories are sure to stay for both."
 fso.165.a:0 "Hooray!"
 fso.166.t:0 "No Way!"
 fso.166.d:0 "Adolf exploded at the mere proposal of Switzerland as a resort. He despised Switzerland and the Swiss people, and would not hear anything about spending any time there."
 fso.166.a:0 "Ahh..."
 fso.167.t:0 "Double Date"
 fso.167.d:0 "The date went rather well, as the two couples enjoyed each other and the company of friends, and some quality time was had both in the day and the night."
 fso.167.a:0 "Funsies!"
 fso.168.t:0 "Old Memories"
 fso.168.d:0 "Linz, the city where Hitler spent a lot of his youth, is a fine city, and the two friends had a lot of fun walking its streets. Hitler spoke a lot about how he wants to retire to Linz one day, living in a house where only Eva Braun and his friends would be able to visit him."
 fso.168.a:0 "We've made great progress."
 fso.169.t:0 "Westhauptstadt Germania"
 fso.169.d:0 "Adolf has invited Dark Buddhist to check out his model of a renovated Berlin, Westhauptstadt Germania. It is an imposing model, and Hitler spent a lot of time on it with his consultants like Albert Speer. It is incomplete, however, and the Fuhrer graciously offered Dark to put a building on the model, but which building should we add?"
 fso.169.a:0 "Why building? Let's add a park!"
 fso.169.b:0 "Make a museum in neoclassical style here."
 fso.169.c:0 "Put a grotesque, moderne, curvy tower in the middle."
 fso.169.dd:0 "Maybe another column?"
 fso.170.t:0 "Another Park"
 fso.170.d:0 "Hitler does indeed like the park idea, but there are already plenty on the model, plus it does not stand out. It is kept on the table, however, and Adolf is pleased."
 fso.170.a:0 "Okay then."
 fso.171.t:0 "Perfect Spot"
 fso.171.d:0 "\"A museum, yes!\", Adolf says excitedly, \"That's exactly what I've been missing here! It will have exhibits of the fine arts, none of that \"modern art\"!\" It seems like your pick has aligned with his vision perfectly."
 fso.171.a:0 "Oh, cool!"
 fso.172.t:0 "Oh no!"
 fso.172.d:0 "You put the tower in the middle. However, as soon as you turn away from it, the tower loses its shaky balance and crashes right into the models, tearing down a good chunk of the buildings on it. Hitler almost had a heart attack, and Dark decides to retreat while it's still possible, extremely embarassed."
 fso.172.a:0 "Uh oh..."
 fso.173.t:0 "Another Column"
 fso.173.d:0 "\"Another one? I suppose can't have too many\", Hitler replies. You look around the model. It seems that there are indeed already a lot of columns on it. Oh well?"
 fso.173.a:0 "It works fine I think!"
 fso.194.t:0 "Culinary Adventures"
 fso.194.d:0 "How to become friends with an Italian? Invite them to have some good food with you! At least, that's what we are hoping for. So far Mussolini replied to our invitation with curiousity, and it is up to us to determine the destination!"
 fso.194.a:0 "Paris, France"
 fso.194.b:0 "Naples, Italy"
 fso.194.c:0 "London, UK"
 fso.194.dd:0 "Munich, Germany"
 fso.195.t:0 "Naples"
 fso.195.d:0 "Both Dark and Benito had tons of fun on this one! Pizza, lasagne, pasta, fruits and delicacies grown in Mediterannean sun and caught in Mediterannean sea (referred to by Mussolini only as Mare Nostrum) all left a great taste. We are way ahead on this!"
 fso.195.a:0 "Awesome!"
 fso.196.t:0 "Paris"
 fso.196.d:0 "The French cuisine is pretty decent, although not exactly without shortcomings. Nevertheless, you two had great fun all around and it seems like Benito enjoyed your company."
 fso.196.a:0 "Could have gone worse."
 fso.197.t:0 "London"
 fso.197.d:0 "Probably the worst possible destination you could have picked. The British know very little about cooking delicious meals, and the variety is lacking. Benito felt very uncomfortable in this hostile environment, and it does not help your efforts."
 fso.197.a:0 "Darn!"
 fso.198.t:0 "Munich"
 fso.198.d:0 "While the Germans cook better than the British, this destination is bad for a completely different reason - political. Benito could not hide his resentment towards the Germans, and they responded in kind. Overall the trip left a sour taste - quite the opposite of the goals a culinary trip has!"
 fso.198.a:0 "Scheisse!"
 fso.199.t:0 "Prank The Greeks"
 fso.199.d:0 "It's just a social experiment! What would happen if for one day the Italian secret service would have swapped all Greek flags in Athens to..."
 fso.199.a:0 "Russian!"
 fso.199.b:0 "Bulgarian!"
 fso.199.c:0 "Turkish!"
 fso.199.dd:0 "Persian!"
 fso.200.t:0 "Russian"
 fso.200.d:0 "Maybe that was not such a great idea... The Greeks did not even get that angry! They just took down the flags and replaced them with their own. Mussolini was visibly disappointed."
 fso.200.a:0 "Not Good!"
 fso.201.t:0 "Bulgarian"
 fso.201.d:0 "This was pretty good! The Greeks got quite upset. The government made an official statement to the public that the perpetrators (now giggling across the Adriatic) will be persecuted and punished accordingly."
 fso.201.a:0 "Haha!"
 fso.202.t:0 "Turkish"
 fso.202.d:0 "Now this is what we call a good prank! The Greeks got immediately angry as soon as the flags were discovered. Riots in the streets erupted, calling for immediate military retaliation against the Turkish government for such a \"cowardly attempt at underhanded propaganda\". Mussolini laughed for two hours straight."
 fso.202.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 fso.203.t:0 "Persian"
 fso.203.d:0 "This one got them! A few Persian stores were burned and some beaten as suspected perpetrators of this blasphemy before the police intervened and dispersed the mobs. Benito was quite amused at this."
 fso.203.a:0 "Very cool!"
 fso.204.t:0 "Prank The Greeks Once More"
 fso.204.d:0 "The government of Greece would like to arrange a meeting with Italy. Dark Buddhist thinks that perhaps this could be an opportunity to prank the Greeks again by setting the meeting to happen in..."
 fso.204.a:0 "Istanbul!"
 fso.204.b:0 "Rome!"
 fso.204.c:0 "Tunisia!"
 fso.204.dd:0 "Smyrna!"
 fso.205.t:0 "Smyrna"
 fso.205.d:0 "It hurt the Greeks greatly to have to negotiate in such a place. The memories of the great fire here are still fresh, and the dead are still mourned for. The Turks looked arrogant as well, making the situation a lot worse. Benito, on the other hand, laughed at the Greeks and encouraged Dark to prank together again someday."
 fso.205.a:0 "It was good but I feel bad..."
 fso.206.t:0 "Rome"
 fso.206.d:0 "What a boring choice! Sure, it did hurt the Greek dignity a little bit, but they were prepared well for something like this to happen, after all they wanted a meeting with the Italian government. Mussolini was disappointed."
 fso.206.a:0 "Meh."
 fso.207.t:0 "Tunisia"
 fso.207.d:0 "Neither delegation felt any happier when they arrived. Tunis was not a very welcoming place, and both italians and greeks hold a disdain for it. Mussolini was very aggressive and irritable and did not seem pleased."
 fso.207.a:0 "Oopsie."
 fso.208.t:0 "Istanbul"
 fso.208.d:0 "Ohh, you should have seen the Greeks! They were practically fuming at the insult, but agreed to the meeting anyway. Benito tried very, very hard not to laugh out loud - but failed a couple of times, embarassing the greek delegation further."
 fso.208.a:0 "Nice choice!"
 fso.209.t:0 "Dreams of Roman Empire"
 fso.209.d:0 "Together with Benito you are chilling in the summer residence, dreaming about restoration of Roman Empire. Benito is discussing his plans of conquest, while Dark is trying to convince him in a more friendly approach. Another thing Dark mentioned in the discussion was..."
 fso.209.a:0 "...how great it would be to restore all Roman monuments."
 fso.209.b:0 "...how much better would it be if we all were Roman."
 fso.209.c:0 "...that perhaps Benito should reconcile with Orthodoxy."
 fso.209.dd:0 "...that maybe Moscow is the best seat for Roman Empire."
 fso.210.t:0 "Roman Monuments"
 fso.210.d:0 "\"Yes!\" said Benito. \"Most definitely! We must restore the Colosseum, and maybe even have some fights organised there!\" It seems like he is quite interested in the idea."
 fso.210.a:0 "Nice!"
 fso.211.t:0 "Romanization"
 fso.211.d:0 "Benito looked at Dark for a moment and then went into a long, long tirade about how he intends to bring first Italy and then Europe to embrace the Roman culture and traditions. This is a very engaging topic for him!"
 fso.211.a:0 "We did good!"
 fso.212.t:0 "Reconcile With Orthodoxy"
 fso.212.d:0 "Mussolini's face turns into a displeased grimace. He says something along the lines of \"I do not want to negotiate with the Greeks\" and that in general he disapproves of the Church."
 fso.212.a:0 "Ohh."
 fso.213.t:0 "Moscow Third Rome"
 fso.213.d:0 "Benito's face turns red. He is furious, and insulted at the mere thought of Roman Empire's capital being anywhere other than Rome. Sure, the Emperors of old had to move it to other cities for strategic reasons, but nowadays this is just not necessary - especially not to Moscow!"
 fso.213.a:0 "Uh oh."
 fso.234.t:0 "Sakura Garden"
 fso.234.d:0 "Japan! A beautiful, yet mysterious country. As Dark Buddhist and Hirohito take a stroll down the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo, surrounded by guards, they engage in a thoughtful conversation about various aspects of life. Emperor Hirohito was rather impressed by the level of Japanese language shown by Dark and complimented him on it. As the two walked under blossoming sakura trees, they conversed about..."
 fso.234.a:0 "...intricacies of modern war."
 fso.234.b:0 "...importance and value of preserving culture."
 fso.234.c:0 "...various historic events and notable persons."
 fso.234.dd:0 "...the rise of United States to a world power status."
 fso.235.t:0 "Culture"
 fso.235.d:0 "It was wonderful! Hirohito passionately spoke of his appreciation of culture and fine arts, and of his dream to kickstart a new cultural golden age in Japan. We grew closer."
 fso.235.a:0 "Cool!"
 fso.236.t:0 "War"
 fso.236.d:0 "This topic brought no joy to the Emperor of the Rising Sun. He seemed very upset by it, in fact, and expressed grief over the militarism everpresent in Japan, yet admitted that it is probably a necessity for Japan."
 fso.236.a:0 "This is sad..."
 fso.237.t:0 "History"
 fso.237.d:0 "Hirohito and Dark spent a long time discussing and sharing knowledge of history of their respective regions. It was quite productive."
 fso.237.a:0 "That's fine."
 fso.238.t:0 "USA"
 fso.238.d:0 "The Emperor of Japan was disgusted by the choice of subject. The Americans in his mind bear no culture, and do not respect anyone else. They believe Japan is weak and degenerate, technologically behind the Western powers."
 fso.238.a:0 "Uh oh, he mad..."
 fso.239.t:0 "Party In Manchuria"
 fso.239.d:0 "To escape the boundaries of Imperial Capital, Dark offered a trip to Manchuria. Hirohito agreed, and soon the two were already travelling around the Manchurian countryside. Dark Buddhist had something else planned, however..."
 fso.239.a:0 "...troll the Qing Emperor!"
 fso.239.b:0 "...prank the Soviet border guard!"
 fso.239.c:0 "...have some fun with the local regiments!"
 fso.239.dd:0 "...sabotage something Chinese!"
 fso.240.t:0 "Qing Emperor"
 fso.240.d:0 "Hirohito was not very pleased with the idea of making fun of another asian ruler - no matter the current political status, they were still a legitimate heir of the Qing dynasty."
 fso.240.a:0 "It was just a prank, bro!"
 fso.241.t:0 "Prank Soviets"
 fso.241.d:0 "In the middle of the night, Hirohito and Dark scared the poor Soviet soldiers by staging an attack of \"ghosts\"! It was all in good fun, though, of course."
 fso.241.a:0 "Funsies, yay!"
 fso.242.t:0 "Party Hard!"
 fso.242.d:0 "It was a blast! A big party was thrown together with the locals and Japanese troops, all equally enjoying the night!"
 fso.242.a:0 "Awesome!"
 fso.243.t:0 "Sabotage"
 fso.243.d:0 "We picked our target and, accompanied by elite Japanese forces, made a swift incursion into Chinese lands. It was a success, and what a thrilling experience!"
 fso.243.a:0 "That was cool!"
 fso.244.t:0 "Tokyo Magic"
 fso.244.d:0 "Back from Manchuria, the duo decided to hang out in Tokyo for some time and chill. Or perhaps we should go out? Let's decide then..."
 fso.244.a:0 "Make the military throw a big parade for us!"
 fso.244.b:0 "Sushi Throwing Fight! Woo!"
 fso.244.c:0 "Ask Hirohito for some katana lessons!"
 fso.244.dd:0 "Perhaps, we should just be moderate."
 fso.245.t:0 "Parade"
 fso.245.d:0 "The military might of Japan is truly impressive. The nation has advanced quite rapidly in terms of technology, especially aircraft. The parade left a lasting impression on Dark Buddhist."
 fso.245.a:0 "Good!"
 fso.246.t:0 "Sushi Fight"
 fso.246.d:0 "Hirohito has decidedly refused to participate in such \"childish, uncultured activity\". The rest of the time in Tokyo was fairly sour."
 fso.246.a:0 "Ouch..."
 fso.247.t:0 "Katana Lessons"
 fso.247.d:0 "Swordfighting skill is one of the crucial parts of the Way of the Warrior. Despite the philosophy and the famed samurai becoming bygones, the Warrior Spirit still lives in the people of Japan. Hirohito was happy to share what he was taught growing up with Darku."
 fso.247.a:0 "Ki-yah!"
 fso.248.t:0 "Moderate Visit"
 fso.248.d:0 "Nothing pompous - just a quiet visit of the city together with very few courtiers and the guard. It was very relaxing and lovely."
 fso.248.a:0 "Amazing!"
 fso.249.t:0 "Envisioning Empire"
 fso.249.d:0 "Hirohito is troubled with thoughts of his young and rising Empire. Dark Buddhist considers the possibilities to try to help his friend make up their mind..."
 fso.249.a:0 "North Doctrine sounds good!"
 fso.249.b:0 "Is it even wise to wage more wars?"
 fso.249.c:0 "USA has to kneel before Japan!"
 fso.249.dd:0 "South Doctrine sounds good!"
 fso.250.t:0 "North Doctrine"
 fso.250.d:0 "Cold wastes of Siberia? They are worthless! And besides, Japan cannot stand up to USSR alone, risking the US sanctions."
 fso.250.a:0 "Oof"
 fso.251.t:0 "More Wars?"
 fso.251.d:0 "Hirohito looked at Dark with sympathy and said that he would love to never plunge the Empire into flames of war. His heart bleeds when he thinks about lives that would be wasted in a brutal war. However, his generals and admirals are set in their expansionalism, and the parliament supports them as well."
 fso.251.a:0 "At least Hirohito can rely on Dark."
 fso.252.t:0 "USA"
 fso.252.d:0 "USA is too dangerous for Japan to take on directly - the country lacks resources, industries, land and manpower, despite technologically being at least on par, if not better."
 fso.252.a:0 "Foolish!"
 fso.253.t:0 "South Doctrine"
 fso.253.d:0 "This is what Hirohito and most of his advisors usually lean towards. The European powers are far away, and the time has long past for their imperialism to end, and Asia to become free."
 fso.253.a:0 "Good!"
 fso.214.t:0 "Good Intent"
 fso.214.d:0 "Our first informal meeting with Roosevelt is happening shortly! To make a good impression, Dark decided to invest into something that Roosevelt would like..."
 fso.214.a:0 "An Abandoned Dockyard!"
 fso.214.b:0 "Wall Street!"
 fso.214.c:0 "Coca-Cola Factory!"
 fso.214.dd:0 "Wildlife Protection Agency!"
 fso.215.t:0 "Coca-Cola Factory"
 fso.215.d:0 "A good choice! Like many Americans, Franklin Delano Roosevelt is a fan of the drinks they produce. However, it feels like we could have done better?.."
 fso.215.a:0 "Maybe yes?"
 fso.216.t:0 "Abandoned Dockyard"
 fso.216.d:0 "USA is a naval empire, and extra dockyards will definitely not hurt. But perhaps we could have achieved more with our money, as there are already a lot of investors in dockyards."
 fso.216.a:0 "Yeah, the competition is high."
 fso.217.t:0 "Wildlife Protection"
 fso.217.d:0 "Some criticized our non-obvious choice, but president Roosevelt grinned, showing that he approves our decision. Indeed, the wildlife suffers, and we must not forget about mother nature."
 fso.217.a:0 "Nature is important!"
 fso.218.t:0 "Wall Street"
 fso.218.d:0 "Sure, this may be a lucrative choice in the long run, but that makes us look no better than anyone, if not worse. Roosevelt was definitely not very pleased."
 fso.218.a:0 "Sad :("
 fso.219.t:0 "Weekend Together"
 fso.219.d:0 "Our time in USA has so far been pretty pleasant, and Roosevelt decided to let Dark plan out the upcoming weekend. We are going to..."
 fso.219.a:0 "...a hunting trip!"
 fso.219.b:0 "...chill in NY theatres!"
 fso.219.c:0 "...a spa!"
 fso.219.dd:0 "...visit a casino!"
 fso.220.t:0 "Hunting Trip"
 fso.220.d:0 "What an awful choice! Roosevelt likes animals and definitely did not have a good time shooting at them."
 fso.220.a:0 "Oh no!"
 fso.221.t:0 "New York"
 fso.221.d:0 "Broadway is one of America's landmarks, and deservedly so! It was a lot of fun to go around theatres and chill, watching plays and musicals."
 fso.221.a:0 "Fun times!"
 fso.222.t:0 "Spa"
 fso.222.d:0 "Franklin Delano Roosevelt is not a young man anymore - a spa is just what the doctor ordered! He thanked Dark afterwards for allowing this opportunity to relax and unwind."
 fso.222.a:0 "Glad to help!"
 fso.223.t:0 "Casino"
 fso.223.d:0 "Who doesn't like a good casino visit? Shiny colourful lights, loud noises, games, games, games, wins, wins, wins! Indulging in this can be fun and even somehow relaxing."
 fso.223.a:0 "Great!"
 fso.224.t:0 "War Talks"
 fso.224.d:0 "The situation in the world is growing darker. Greed, despair and loneliness are driving nations to war, which is most likely going to happen soon. President Roosevelt asked Dark Buddhist about his stance on what the United States should do - what do we say?"
 fso.224.a:0 "Lend lease France and Britain"
 fso.224.b:0 "Acknowledge and ally USSR"
 fso.224.c:0 "Guarantee independence of Poland"
 fso.224.dd:0 "Avoid intervening directly"
 fso.225.t:0 "Lend Lease"
 fso.225.d:0 "This is pretty moderate, but allows USA to help its allies without directly interfering. Sounds like a good idea on paper."
 fso.225.a:0 "Cool beans"
 fso.226.t:0 "Ally USSR"
 fso.226.d:0 "USSR already showed that they do not mind warmongering, and Stalin is a ruthless dictator! Such an alliance would never happen. Ever!"
 fso.226.a:0 "Sorry..."
 fso.227.t:0 "Guarantee Poland"
 fso.227.d:0 "Roosevelt tells you that this is a really bad idea because it will put USA on a path of direct confrontation - something that he wants to avoid as much as possible."
 fso.227.a:0 "Ah, mistake"
 fso.228.t:0 "Avoid Intervening"
 fso.228.d:0 "Roosevelt passionately agrees with you, stating that USA needs to keep its distance for the good of the world and the country. If USA tries to extend their influence elsewhere, it won't lead to anything good."
 fso.228.a:0 "Let's hope for the best"
 fso.229.t:0 "A Visit To Bohemia"
 fso.229.d:0 "USA so far has been very hospitable for us - it's time to maybe pay back with the same. Dark Buddhist has invited Roosevelt to his home country, and Franklin accepted. However, Dark did not yet decide how to treat his guest..."
 fso.229.a:0 "Tour in Prague"

 fso.230.d:0 "Prague is an old, beautiful city, and as the capital it would make sense to spend most of the time there. Roosevelt enjoyed time spent with his friend Dark and was seemingly pleased."
 fso.230.a:0 "We did fine"
 fso.231.t:0 "Hot Springs"
 fso.231.d:0 "Franklin was extremely happy to spend at least some time away from the big cities in the comfort of a spa resort. He said that he has never felt better before."
 fso.231.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.232.t:0 "Prank Axis"
 fso.232.d:0 "While fun for the first few minutes or so, this quickly became boring, and having a whole trip just for that is a bit pointless. Roosevelt definitely did not enjoy this prospect very much - he expected more from a friend."
 fso.232.a:0 "I just tried to have fun..."
 fso.233.t:0 "Czech Paradise"
 fso.233.d:0 "The visit went great, and Dark had a blast of a time together with his friend Franklin. However, all good things must come to an end, and so does this trip."
 fso.233.a:0 "Come again soon!"
 fso.174.t:0 "A Grand Roadtrip"
 fso.174.d:0 "Befriending someone intimidating like Stalin will not be easy - especially not on his home turf. Let's bait him out of Moscow on a roadtrip! But where to?"
 fso.174.a:0 "Novgorod!"
 fso.174.b:0 "Near Siberia!"
 fso.174.c:0 "Novorossia!"
 fso.174.dd:0 "Desert trip to Tashkent!"
 fso.175.t:0 "Siberia"
 fso.175.d:0 "The cold wastes of Siberia are surprisingly exciting to visit! The untouched nature around and excited Stalin talking about how this will all be reformed to serve the Union sure leave a lasting impression. And Stalin opened up a lot for us!"
 fso.175.a:0 "Excellent!"
 fso.176.t:0 "Tashkent"
 fso.176.d:0 "A curious destination, Tashkent is definitely what can be described as \"backwater\". But, maybe that's exactly what was needed? It seems like Stalin eased up a bit and turned his friendlier side to us."
 fso.176.a:0 "Good job?"
 fso.177.t:0 "Novorossia"
 fso.177.d:0 "Dubbed this way a long, long time ago, this area is lush and lucrative. Unfortunately, it still remembers the mismanagement disaster which caused a massive famine. This definitely made Stalin's shell crack, and he opened up to Dark about his inner struggles to cope with this."
 fso.177.a:0 "That's a good start"
 fso.178.t:0 "Novgorod"
 fso.178.d:0 "This was pretty awful. Not only did Stalin dislike the city and the surrounding drama with Ford dealing with the Soviet Union, but generally we did not achieve the goal of making Stalin more open towards us."
 fso.178.a:0 "Pity"
 fso.179.t:0 "Evening Arrives..."
 fso.179.d:0 "One fateful evening during the trip, Stalin, Dark and their accompanies gathered around a fire and decided to..."

 fso.180.d:0 "What a boring answer! You slept well (with Stalin) and saw no dreams. The end. (The Narrator leaves)"
 fso.180.a:0 "Hey Narrator, come back here!"
 fso.181.t:0 "Spooky Scary"
 fso.181.d:0 "Seems like everyone had a great spooky story to share! Stalin told a very, very scary story about a secret capitalist getting voted in as General Secretary and passing reforms called \"Perestroika\". Gave everyone else around shivers!"
 fso.181.a:0 "AAH!"
 fso.182.t:0 "Stars"
 fso.182.d:0 "This was wonderful! Dark and Stalin spent many hours watching stars and connecting them into various communist symbols like hammers and sickles and wheat stacks. Stalin got very emotional and it seems like he considers us a good friend now."
 fso.182.a:0 "That's amazing!"
 fso.183.t:0 "Prank Stalin"
 fso.183.d:0 "Poor guy! He got very scared when Dark and the rest made it seem like they have abandoned Stalin alone in the woods. When they finally revealed the prank, he was not happy at all."
 fso.183.a:0 "Ohh."
 fso.184.t:0 "Crossing Volga"
 fso.184.d:0 "The great river Volga feeds many Russian cities - even Moscow river is a part of it! Crossing it, we have observed many various intricacies of Stalingrad, the namesake city of Stalin himself."
 fso.184.a:0 "It can use some forts I think."
 fso.184.b:0 "Let's stay here and swim!"
 fso.184.c:0 "Oh yes, the vikings used to sail through here!"
 fso.184.dd:0 "Eww, those pesky local Germans!"
 fso.185.t:0 "Forts"
 fso.185.d:0 "Stalin was very insulted at the thought that Dark believed any army could even dare to strike so deep into the Motherland. Forts would be a sign of cowardice."
 fso.185.a:0 "Ehh, arrogant much?"
 fso.186.t:0 "Swimming"
 fso.186.d:0 "Not the most exciting idea ever, and Stalin definitely expected more of you. But hey - swimming is kinda fun I guess!"
 fso.186.a:0 "Right?"
 fso.187.t:0 "The Vikings"
 fso.187.d:0 "Stalin agreed and for some time Dark and Joseph discussed the history of Russia and the Viking trade. It was a rather pleasant discussion."
 fso.187.a:0 "Cool!"
 fso.188.t:0 "Germans"
 fso.188.d:0 "Joseph laughed and agreed. He said that he does not really trust them either, and they are not even real Germans anyway. Stalin was really amused by this."
 fso.188.a:0 "A bit of racism warms the soul."
 fso.189.t:0 "Friendship Bus"
 fso.189.d:0 "The road trip was nice, and we are already making plans for the new one. But maybe there is someone who we want to take with us next time? Let's suggest someone!"
 fso.189.a:0 "King Carol of Romania!"
 fso.189.b:0 "Mao Zedong!"
 fso.189.c:0 "Ataturk!"
 fso.189.dd:0 "Mannerheim!"
 fso.190.t:0 "King Carol"
 fso.190.d:0 "Carol sure knows how to throw a good party! Stalin agreed that he is a decent choice, even though he is not a communist."
 fso.190.a:0 "Yay!"
 fso.191.t:0 "Mao Zedong"
 fso.191.d:0 "The Cornered Fox is a great choice! Relations between him and Moscow are pretty tense, and the two communists compete when they should be friends. This is a great opportunity to mend the rift!"
 fso.191.a:0 "Great!"
 fso.192.t:0 "Ataturk"
 fso.192.d:0 "This is a pretty awful idea, and Stalin seems to think so as well. Why would Ataturk even agree? He is not very fun, either."
 fso.192.a:0 "Eh."
 fso.193.t:0 "Mannerheim"
 fso.193.d:0 "What?! But he is German! He doesn't know how to have fun! What a terrible idea."
 fso.193.a:0 "Oops."
 fso.254.t:0 "Grand Strategy"
 fso.254.d:0 "It is now time to prepare a strategic plan to spread the Friendshipism beyond our nation's borders. Dark and his close advisors spend weeks at the Palace, devising plans and operations. We will need to make a decision for each of the opposing ideologies."
 fso.254.a:0 "Think carefully."
 fso.255.t:0 "The Communists"
 fso.255.d:0 "The communist ideology may be fairly close to the ideals of friendship. In theory. It propagates focus on the common people of the nation, promoting communal values and lifestyle. However, in practice the communist countries turn out to be just as, if not more, autocratic than any others, and the focus on the common people hurts them more than it helps."
 fso.255.a:0 "We will formally announce our support of communist countries."
 fso.255.b:0 "It is in our best interests to leave them be."
 fso.255.c:0 "Make no visible action, but support dissidents abroad."
 fso.255.dd:0 "The boldest measures are the safest!"
 fso.256.t:0 "The Fascists"
 fso.256.d:0 "Ultranationalistic regimes are very, very close to us. German rhetoric is openly hostile and the dreams of restoring German Imperial glory are directly threatening us. However, we may still be able to find common ground with the nazis."
 fso.256.a:0 "Pledge our friendship to the NSDAP."
 fso.256.b:0 "We are going to maintain neutrality."
 fso.256.c:0 "We will welcome exiles from Germany and Italy."
 fso.256.dd:0 "They are an open threat to us, and must be removed."
 fso.257.t:0 "The Democrats"
 fso.257.d:0 "On paper, the democratic countries are the friendliest towards us. But it does not feel like we can trust them completely. The people of these countries are still unhappy and cannot call themselves true friends to us. Still, we could try to be at least cordial towards them."
 fso.257.a:0 "Openly proclaim our friendship."
 fso.257.b:0 "Keep our distance."
 fso.257.c:0 "We are going to support the opposition in these countries."

 fso.260.t:0 "Long Distance Relations"
 fso.260.d:0 "Our new doctrine implies the ability to react to anything, anywhere in the world. Our military force needs to adjust to that. We are already recruiting only volunteers, but they may not be enough for our ends. We shall reform the Praetorian Guard into a standing military force, envy of all!"
 fso.260.a:0 "The preparations are to begin now."
 fso.261.t:0 "Army of the New Age"
 fso.261.d:0 "Thanks to our officer staff, the Praetorians are now a powerful corps of military. It forms two main branches: Praetorian Guardsmen and Praetorian Paratroopers. Praetorian Guradsmen are fierce soldiers, equipped in full body armour and issued with a modernized shield, trained using adapted works of greatest Roman generals. Only the best weapons can be given to these elite soldiers, and their combat gear is now ready for production."
 fso.261.tt:0 "\nA number of these divisions stand ready. They require special equipment!\n"
 fso.261.a:0 "A modern army!"
 fso.262.t:0 "The New Nobility"
 fso.262.d:0 "In our new society, the Patricians represent a threat. This needs to be dealt with. Emperor Dark has come up with a nobility reform that benefits both the state and the Patricii. Noble Houses will be established, disjointing the nobles and giving them extra priviliges, allowing the state to benefit from their power and influence on demand."
 fso.262.a:0 "A good idea!"
 fso.263.t:0 "The Three Heads"
 fso.263.d:0 "The reform is finally complete and implemented. Five houses are to be established, House Filia Magia for the royal family, House Hentai for the art patrons, House of Spiders for the massive broodline of nobles, House Tameria for the nationalistic old guard and House Proletariae for those more interested in the works of Marx."

 fso.264.t:0 "House Filia Magia"
 fso.264.d:0 "The Royal House is the most loyal to the Emperor. This is a very small house, consisting of only the family members of Dark. The activities of this House mainly include having fun within their chambers, entertaining the Emperor himself."
 fso.264.a:0 "Work on Memes."
 fso.264.b:0 "Try to determine where does Aroze belong in the family."
 fso.264.c:0 "Hold games with the royal family."
 fso.264.dd:0 "Nevermind..."
 fso.265.t:0 "House of Spiders"
 fso.265.d:0 "A sprawling, massive house is full of nobles, who are connected to each other with bonds of kinship, however distant it may be. The sheer number of members is the source of its power, and the House hall is usually very crowded."
 fso.265.a:0 "Temporarily allow spider nationalism."
 fso.265.b:0 "Force conscript members."
 fso.265.c:0 "Elevate an advisor from this House."
 fso.265.dd:0 "Nevermind..."
 fso.266.t:0 "House Hentai"
 fso.266.d:0 "A den of carnal sins, this House proclaims itself to be the \"patrons of true art\". Their meetings usually consist of sharing explicit drawings from the Far East, orgies and/or therapy sessions. Some nobles and even Praetorians deny membership of this House, but participate in its meetings secretly."
 fso.266.a:0 "Seize \"art\" workshops."
 fso.266.b:0 "Invite House advisors."
 fso.266.c:0 "Encourage genetic research."

 fso.267.t:0 "House Tameria"
 fso.267.d:0 "The first House to be established, this is also the one to consist the members of the militaristic Old Guard. These disgruntled officers spend their time in cultured discussions, political disputes and military tactics comparisons."
 fso.267.a:0 "Make concessions to the Old Guard."
 fso.267.b:0 "Seize military infrastructure."
 fso.267.c:0 "Recruit officers from the ranks."
 fso.267.dd:0 "Nevermind..."
 fso.268.t:0 "House Proletariae"
 fso.268.d:0 "The least noble of all the noble Houses, this one is numerous, and allows even non-nobles membership. This House is also militaristic, and posesses many arms in its hidden caches. They, perhaps, are quietly waiting for some opportunity to \"rise\", although they must realise that this opportunity may never come now."
 fso.268.a:0 "Allow limited self-government."
 fso.268.b:0 "Demand militia's weapons."
 fso.268.c:0 "Invite army commissars."
 fso.268.dd:0 "Nevermind..."
 fso.269.t:0 "Wax and Wane"
 fso.269.d:0 "Noble Houses spend a lot of time in bickering, trying to determine the best by fighting over influence and resources. Sometimes these conflicts lead to empowerment of one House over others. This is exactly what happened recently, as one of the Houses claimed supremacy over others. This is merely a temporary advantage, however the state suffers as a result."
 fso.269.a:0 "Ban Houses when?"
 fso.270.t:0 "Interhouse Rivalry"
 fso.270.d:0 "The unending struggle of Houses continues. Recently, two Houses in particular took the confrontation to a high level, and tensions rise as a result. The populace and nobles look to the Imperial Palace for a possible reaction..."
 fso.270.a:0 "Support the rivalry."
 fso.270.b:0 "Kill it off."
 fso.270.c:0 "Do not interfere."
 fso.271.t:0 "Turncoats"
 fso.271.d:0 "In the continued opposition of Houses, loyalties are truly tested. Some nobles are less noble than others, however, and recently one of the competing Houses experienced a large wave of turncoats changing their House allegiance. This, however, disrupts the balance of the situation in the country, and if we do not enforce the status quo we may suffer bad consequences."
 fso.271.a:0 "Why do we care?"
 fso.271.b:0 "Compensate the losses."
 fso.271.c:0 "Favour the winning house."
 fso.272.t:0 "House Wins Charter"
 fso.272.d:0 "Houses continue to vie for more and more influence and power. This means, however, that they sometimes can increase the overall power of the state as well. One of our noble Houses has just won a massive industrial charter with a foreign company. They do not know for certain what needs to be constructed. Perhaps we can nudge them in the right direction?"
 fso.272.a:0 "Encourage Civilian industry."
 fso.272.b:0 "Support Military industry."
 fso.272.c:0 "Invest in Naval production."
 fso.273.t:0 "Jousting Tournament"
 fso.273.d:0 "In an effort to try to determine which House is the best, the leaders agreed to hold a Jousting Tournament, just like in the old times. This is a nationwide event, and contestants from across the country come to participate. This is a massive congregation of able bodied people, and we could benefit."
 fso.273.a:0 "Stage a recruitment campaign."
 fso.273.b:0 "Improve our officer skills."
 fso.273.c:0 "Let the Houses do the do."
 fso.274.t:0 "Research Opportunity"
 fso.274.d:0 "All Houses have their own research facilities, and sometimes they request the Royal funding for their studies. A research opportunity arose in all of the Houses, and we cannot fund them all at once. What should we prioritize?"
 fso.274.a:0 "House Spiders and climbing tech."
 fso.274.b:0 "House Hentai and hi tech."
 fso.274.c:0 "House Tameria and armour tech."
 fso.274.dd:0 "House Proletariae and infantry tech."
 fso.275.t:0 "Houses Clash"
 fso.275.d:0 "Just recently two of the Houses' bickering escalated into a bloody encounter in the streets of our capital. This is a tragic event, and we may only perform some damage control in this case."
 fso.275.a:0 "Nobody cares!"
 fso.275.b:0 "Pull the strings."
 fso.275.c:0 "Ban instigators."
 fso.276.t:0 "Gift From Nobles"
 fso.276.d:0 "The nobility is generally content with the government now. Sometimes this may manifest in form of gifts to the state - much like now, for example. What do we do with this gift?"
 fso.276.a:0 "Thank the nobles and spend it on weapons."
 fso.276.b:0 "Thank them and spend it on their needs."
 fso.277.t:0 "Noble Asks For Adoption"
 fso.277.d:0 "Although normally nobles may float between Houses as much as their loyalty allows, generally nobody is accepted into House Filia Magia. Members of the Royal Family may only be picked personally by the Emperor. A noble from one of the houses pleads Dark personally to be adopted into the family along with his courtiers."
 fso.277.a:0 "Adopt them."
 fso.277.b:0 "Exile him for breaking obligations."
 fso.277.c:0 "Turn in the noble back to his House."
 fso.278.t:0 "Trouble Stirs"
 fso.278.d:0 "Despite the Sudeten crisis seemingly resolved, the region is still causing problems. The Nazi leadership still seeks to claim these territories, using ethnic germans living there as a pretext. Reports are coming in that these people grow agitated and uppity. Seems like trouble is brewing in Sudetenland. Move in the military?"
 fso.278.a:0 "Move in the military."
 fso.278.tt:0 "\nIt is strongly suggested that you move your troops over to Sudetenland and Eastern Sudetenland!"
 fso.279.t:0 "A Sinister Minister"
 fso.279.d:0 "A disaster struck! We just received reports that german armed forces have crossed the border in Sudetenland and Eastern Sudetenland, securing multiple settlements! The local Germans are split into those who support the Nazis and those who are loyal to us! Our military is resisting the enemy advances.\nLittle is known as of yet, but Hitler's personal communication may have cleared some clouds. It would appear that a few Nazi high ranking officials have acted against direct orders, took a few divisions and attempted to perform this insurgency. The German army will not turn on their comrades, and the divisions involved do not respond to any communication. It seems like our only option is to win."
 fso.279.a:0 "Emperor protects!"
 fso.280.t:0 "Sudetenland Falls"
 fso.280.d:0 "Unfortunately, the insurgent forces succeeded in securing our installations in Sudetenland proper. This does not bode well for us..."
 fso.280.a:0 "Hold the lines!"
 fso.281.t:0 "Sudetenland Holds"
 fso.281.d:0 "It seems that our military has pushed back the invaders in Sudetenland proper, securing all lost holdings! Nice!"
 fso.281.a:0 "We are in the right!"
 fso.282.t:0 "Stalemate"
 fso.282.d:0 "The hostilities lasted for quite some time, but it would appear that none of the sides can achieve any progress."
 fso.282.a:0 "At least we learned something."
 fso.283.t:0 "Eastern Sudetenland Falls"
 fso.283.d:0 "The traitorous Germans have secured the Eastern Sudetenland. This is a big blow to us."
 fso.283.a:0 "Hold the other areas better!"
 fso.284.t:0 "Eastern Sudetenland Stands"
 fso.284.d:0 "Our army has kicked the traitors out of the Eastern Sudetenland! Amazing!"
 fso.284.a:0 "Clear out the rest of them!"
 fso.285.t:0 "The Bratislava Conference"
 fso.285.d1:0 "The conflict was a tragic disaster. In less than three months, the German insurgents secured both Eastern and Western Sudetenlands, resulting in effective loss of control. The local population is overjoyed, with dissidents forcefully removed. Hitler and his inner circle are trying to save face by justifying the conquest post-factum, which is exactly the result the traitors wanted. Now, the Bratislava Conference will decide the fate of Sudetenlands..."
 fso.285.d2:0 "The conflict resulted in a glorious victory. Our forces performed excellently, and destroyed the invaders. Nothing is left of the traitors' plot, but the world community stands furious at this outrageous attempt. Openly everyone on the Conference speaks out against the German leadership for even allowing such an unjust act to happen. This is our chance to push for a full German demilitarization."
 fso.285.d3:0 "Although we have managed to push the invading forces out of Eastern Sudetenland, or at least hold off long enough, the Western part has fallen in the hands of Germans. The solution they propose is outlandish - they will pull out from the territory if they are allowed to take all ethnic Germans with them."
 fso.285.d4:0 "Although we have managed to push the invading forces out of Western Sudetenland, or at least hold off long enough, the Eastern part has fallen in the hands of Germans. The solution they propose is outlandish - they will pull out from the territory if they are allowed to take all ethnic Germans with them."
 fso.285.d5:0 "After three long months of fighting, the dust finally settles, and the sides now convene at the Conference. With the help of foreign mediators the conflict is resolved as such: the traitors are to be publicly punished, the German forces - completely removed from the lands of Friendship Order. Effective immediately."
 fso.285.a:0 "This is a stain of shame."
 fso.285.b:0 "A total and complete disarmament!"
 fso.285.c:0 "We don't have a choice."
 fso.285.dd:0 "We don't have a choice."
 fso.285.e:0 "At least we had some target practice."
 fso.286.t:0 "Fixing a Court"
 fso.286.d:0 "The recent events caused some concern among the noble houses - what would happen if, by certainly an unfortunate turn of events, our glorious leader Dark Buddhist were to die? What would become of the throne, and, by extension, our Friendship Order? The Emperor decided to act upon these rumours swiftly, vowing to develop a document clearly outlining the line of succession and securing the noble line."
 fso.286.a:0 "This will be done shortly."
 fso.287.t:0 "Royal Duties"
 fso.287.d:0 "Dark Buddhist has finally completed writing the document, titled Succession Magna Carta, outlining exactly how the succession will work - the document needs only to be signed. The Emperor looked out the window of his study, watching as a flock of birds flies into the sunset. For a minute, he wondered if he is feeling tired at all of ruling and all these politics..."
 fso.287.a:0 "Yes, maybe at some point soon..."
 fso.288.t:0 "Succession Secured"
 fso.288.d:0 "In a grand ceremony today Emperor Dark Buddhist, greeted by a standing ovation of the Senate and the nobility, proclaimed the Succession Magna Carta, a document written by his own hand. In it, the succession, in case of Dark's disappearance, is outlined as follows: next in line is Emperor's own brother, Peetry, and the second in line is the Emperor's son, Lamatrepide. Beyond that, Dark proclaimed to the gathered that..."
 fso.288.a:0 "...the Emperor would like to retire someday."
 fso.288.b:0 "...the Emperor would never abandon the Order."
 fso.288.tt1:0 "This enables Dark to retire via a decision and enables Royal Marriages."
 fso.288.tt2:0 "This simply enables Royal Marriages."
 fso.289.t:0 "The Lama Coup"
 fso.289.d:0 "Ever since Peetry's succession to the throne, many nobles and officers quietly voiced their concerns of his capability to rule. They always seemed to favour Lamatrepide, a kind-hearted, naive character... perhaps not as difficult to control as Peetry would prove to be. No matter the reasons, these conspirators distanced themselves from the court, until eventually, today, they presented the Imperial Palace with an ultimatum: either Peetry willfully abdicates in favour of Lamatrepide, or they will force him to. Our nation is on a brink of a civil war, as Peetry is not willing to stand down..."
 fso.289.a:0 "Peetry is just! We must follow the Succession Magna Carta!"
 fso.289.b:0 "Peetry is not fit to rule! Lamatrepide is our Emperor!"
 fso.290.t:0 "Replies Come In"

 fso.291.a:0 "The princess is in awe! Take her now!"
 fso.291.b:0 "The horror! Peetry used the wrong fork to eat fish!"
 fso.292.t:0 "A Personal Union"
 fso.292.d:0 "Charm and beauty are indeed sometimes stronger than any cannons and guns! It appears that our marriage policy resulted in a Personal Union over another nation, and now we rule both as one!"
 fso.292.a:0 "Take that, von Habsburgs!"
 fso.293.t:0 "Lamatrepide's Marriage"
 fso.293.d:0 "It has been decided to secure Lama's future by acquiring a nice French princess for him. We have reached out to French Bourbons and Bonapartes, and we hope they will answer favourably."
 fso.293.a:0 "Let's wait and see!"
 fso.294.t:0 "Bourbon Princess!"
 fso.294.d:0 "A reply from the Bourbons came not in form of a letter, but in form of a royal carriage that arrived in Prague today. Outside stepped a lovely, cute looking girl - a princess of the Bourbon dynasty. She gracefully gave us a letter, in which the Bourbons express their good wishes and offer this princess as a bride. They hope that our relationships will improve as a result!"

 fso.295.d:0 "A reply from the Bonapartes came not in form of a letter, but in form of a royal carriage that arrived in Prague today. Outside stepped a lovely, cute looking girl - a princess of the Bonaparte dynasty. She gracefully gave us a letter, in which the Bonapartes express their good wishes and offer this princess as a bride. They hope that our relationships will improve as a result!"
 fso.295.a:0 "She's a cutie!"
 fso.296.t:0 "French Refusal"
 fso.296.d:0 "Both replies came in on the same day. The royal families express their sorrow, but at the moment they do not think it strategically wise to allow such a royal marriage. It is hinted that they consider our noble line not noble enough."
 fso.296.a:0 "This is insulting!"
 fso.297.t:0 "Friendship Games"
 fso.297.d:0 "By a royal decree today it was announced that the regular Friendship Games are to begin! Our whole nation is preparing for the festivities and funsies."
 fso.297.a:0 "Friendship is Magic!"
 fso.298.t:0 "Spread the Love!"
 fso.298.d:0 "Our internal politics sorted, our army is functional and reformed, now is the time to look outwards! So many nations struggle under the yoke of tyrants, bankers, bureaucrats - waiting to be relieved. News already reached us that many are adopting our newfound ideology as the ideal society model. We should reach out to them and organise - to further achieve our goals."
 fso.298.a:0 "It is the beginning of a new tomorrow."
 fso.299.t:0 "Time to be Awesome"
 fso.299.d:0 "The time has come. We reached out to our friends abroad, and finally, we have an answer. Friendshipist cells have contacted us, asking for aid in staging a friendshipist coup in their country. Emperor Dark Buddhist has made a public statement, proclaiming the creation of "United Friendships", an international organisation aimed at world peace and ending all possible conflicts, in opposition to the clearly failing League of Nations. A new age is coming - and we are its heralds."
 fso.299.a:0 "Peace through power!"
 fso.299.tt:0 "We will be able to assist other countries in installing friendship government.\n"
 fso.300.t:0 "Friendshipism Rising"

 fso.301.t:0 "Cells in [fso_friendship_cells.GetName] Seek Aid!"
 fso.301.d:0 "We have been contacted by the fledgeling organisation calling itself "[fso_friendship_cells.GetFriendshipParty]". They seek to overthrow their tyrannic regime present currently, and want our help. If they succeed in establishing the Friendship rule, they pledge to join United Friendships. Should we provide support?"
 fso.301.a:0 "No!"
 fso.301.tt1:0 "\nWe will be contacted again after some time, from another cell (some time after the cooldown period)."
 fso.301.b:0 "Yeah!"
 fso.301.tt2:0 "\nWe will be able to influence the cell's activities through the decisions."
 fso.302.t:0 "Friendship Prevails!"
 fso.302.d:0 "The Friendshipist cell has secured control! We are now part of United Friendships."
 fso.302.a:0 "Harmony!"
 fso.310.t:0 "The Regime Prevails!"
 fso.310.d:0 "Unfortunately, our friendshipist organisation has failed in the civil war. We will have to wait and try again."
 fso.310.a:0 "Curses!"
 fso.303.t:0 "Civil War Over"
 fso.303.d:0 "The civil war that we ignited is now over. If friendshipists won, they are now part of our faction, and if the regime prevailed, we will just have to try again."
 fso.303.tt:0 "Cleanup!"
 fso.303.a:0 "No matter the outcome, we soldier on."
 fso.304.t:0 "Action Beats Talk"
 fso.304.d:0 "When United Friendships was formed, one of its founding principles was world peace and getting rid of the military. While impossible to remove completely just now, we can start somewhere. We need to implement a set of rules that all nations in United Friendships have to abide - full demilitarization, and nothing less, will do."
 fso.304.a:0 "Peace in our time."
 fso.305.t:0 "Break the Wheel"
 fso.305.d:0 "The regulations, Article 21, are now in place. We can now enforce disarmament of our current United Friendships member, almost stripping them bare of their army and banning recruitment."
 fso.305.a:0 "We drop our weapons as a symbol of peace."
 fso.305.tt:0 "This allows decisions to disarm faction members."
 fso.306.t:0 "Shining City on a Hill"
 fso.306.d:0 "Emperor Dark Buddhist looked outside of his palace windows. He saw a beautiful capital of the Order, the United Friendships Palace, the noble house halls, Praetorian Guard barracks, the Friendship Games stadium. However, evil was still out there in the world. Blackened hearts of ice plotting and manipulating, attempting to destroy all that is dear to someone else - millions still lost in the darkness, suffering under tyranny. This has to be stopped. This will be stopped."
 fso.306.a:0 "The Emperor locks himself in his halls..."
 fso.307.t:0 "Dream of Friendship"
 fso.307.d:0 "After months of seclusion, the Emperor unlocked his chambers once more. He presented his concerned subjects a gift - a model of a magnificent, beautiful city, the project of Utopia, to be built instead and around Prague, keeping its beauty intact and changing ugly parts. The city project will take a lot of resources, and we will require a joint effort of the whole United Friendships to achieve this Dream. But once complete, all will see that we are benevolent, and come to accept our rule!"
 fso.307.a:0 "And then we shall have peace."
 fso.307.tt:0 "You can build the Victory Wonder via a decision. You need 50 subjects at least to do this."
 fso.308.t:0 "The Munich Conference"
 fso.308.d:0 "When Emperor Dark heard about the Allied plans to betray him, he was furious. Immediately he travelled to Munich and broke into the conference, fuming and giving a passionate speech. Impressed by his orator skills, the Allies pressed the Germans and the latter backed down. We are safe!"
 fso.308.a:0 "Hooray!"
 fso.308.tt:0 "This event replaces the standard Sudetenland events."
 fso.311.t:0 "The Senate Fire"
 fso.311.d:0 "A terrible event has occured today. The Senate building was set ablaze by unknown conspirators in the middle of a session. The arsonists have managed to escape the scene amidst panic and confusion.\nFire brigades only managed to put out the fire by the end of the day, and countless senators died under the rubble.\nThis is clearly a political act, and the fascist party insists that the blame is to be put on the communist party, the members of which were conveniently absent on the day of the fire."
 fso.311.a:0 "It makes sense."
 fso.moderatelean:0 "This may please the fascists in our country.\n"
 fso.311.b:0 "I will personally lead the investigation against them."
 fso.darkerlean:0 "Darkness spreads, slowly...\n"
 fso.311.c:0 "Surely, the Senate will decide their fate."
 fso.demolean:0 "Our allegiances are clear.\n"
 fso.311.dd:0 "Let's not jump to conclusions."
 fso.friendshiplean:0 "Perhaps we should just trust Dark.\n"
 fso.311.e:0 "Wait a minute, didn't fascists veto the communist party the session before?"
 fso.darkestlean:0 "The heart grows darker, colder...\n"
 fso.312.t:0 "The Public Speech"
 fso.312.d:0 "It seems as if the Fascists are acting without any regards towards the acting government or the Senate. Today, their leader Arische Ehefrau held a speech in front of millions of people in Prague, and the crowds were enchanted with it. This is deeply disturbing, and the speeches contain some very concerning messages."
 fso.312.a:0 "Well you know they have a point."
 fso.312.b:0 "Not only a point, I agree with everything said!"
 fso.312.c:0 "Surely we should consult with the Senate first."
 fso.312.dd:0 "This must be stopped. Move in the Guard!"
 fso.312.e:0 "This... this is treason, isn't it?"
 fso.313.t:0 "Assault Divisions"
 fso.313.d:0 "This is getting real. Encouraged by frequent speeches, volunteers are gathering at the fascist rallies and form entire divisions dedicated to \"restoring order and justice\" and \"rooting out the red menace\". What do we do?!"
 fso.313.a:0 "Do we need to do anything?"
 fso.313.b:0 "Actually, I signed up too."
 fso.313.c:0 "Let's raise this topic in the Senate."
 fso.313.dd:0 "Issue a royal decree condemning this. I am the Emperor!"
 fso.313.e:0 "Is this a REBELLION?! Prepare my army immediately!"
 fso.314.t:0 "Battle of Wenceslas Square"
 fso.314.d:0 "A horrific event! The fascist assault divisions attempted to attack and capture the Senate itself! Luckily, our armed forces responded quickly, followed by the Praetorian Guard. No one knows who started shooting first, and in a moment the confrontation turned bloody. As the trial of communists is tomorrow, the entire people of the Friendship Order is watching, holding their breath..."
 fso.314.a:0 "Uhh... I don't think we should have fought them."
 fso.314.b:0 "If only I knew, I would have ordered to not intervene."
 fso.314.c:0 "What does the Senate think of this, I wonder?"
 fso.314.dd:0 "Good thinking by the armed forces and the Guard."
 fso.314.e:0 "Who gave them the orders?! Why does no one care about my opinion?!"
 fso.315.t:0 "Trial of Communists"
 fso.315.d:0 "The fateful day has come. A massive crowd has gathered outside the Senate, as the leaders of communist party were lead inside to stand trial. The procedure took the whole day, with the results of a huge investigation were presented. Dark Buddhist humself acted as a judge, and his verdict..."
 fso.315.a:0 "The fascists have built a convincing case. Guilty!"
 fso.315.b:0 "I truly believe they are guilty without a doubt."
 fso.315.c:0 "The Senate should discuss this again, probably."
 fso.315.dd:0 "I believe this runs deeper than we thought. Not guilty."
 fso.315.e:0 "Guilty, guilty, guilty! And another investigation into the fascist activities!"
 fso.316.t:0 "Praetorian Guard Counsel"
 fso.316.d:0 "\"My Emperor, we are gravely concerned. These are dark times for our nation, and we barely exist for a year!\"\nDrax looks tense. The other PG's don't look any better, however. Each one has performed an investigation, as ordered by Dark, but now they come back with results so contradicting it hurts.\nSpitty, the youngest Guard captain, believes firmly that the communists truly are behind the fire. However, Frontier and Texan are suspicious of the fascists themselves, and bring proof that the fire was staged.\nDrax and Peetry, however, both insist that its all a democratic plot, and the Senators are simply trying to get rid of the competition. Sam and Rivalley counter this, saying that actually the Senators have made a big cake for Dark to show their support."
 fso.316.a:0 "Spitty, you're right."
 fso.316.b:0 "Neither communists or democrats are to be trusted."
 fso.316.c:0 "Cake? Oh, lovely!"
 fso.316.dd:0 "I will conduct my own investigation. In secret."
 fso.316.e:0 "A cake, you say... hmm... I trust you guys..."
 fso.317.t:0 "Fate Calls"
 fso.317.d1:0 "Supported silently or openly by Emperor Dark Buddhist, the Fascist party is unopposed. Patricii Officer Corps, led by Arische Ehefrau, is now in power. The other parties are officially banned and closed, communists are sentenced for eternal exile. The Friendship Order is now a fascist state."
 fso.317.d2:0 "In a series of events no one could have anticipated, Dark Buddhist showed himself to be rather sympathetic to the rising influential fascist movement. The Patricii Officer Corps relented, and elected Dark Buddhist their party leader. Consequently, Dark issued a royal decree that outlaws other parties. Styling himself "Voice of Friendship", he now rules the country with a firm grip."
 fso.317.d3:0 "Lured by the most trusted Guards, Dark Buddhist ate the cake presented by the democrats without much hesitation. It was very delicious at first, and Dark relaxed... One horrifying, nightmarish night of fevers and pains, weakened, fainting, dying, but alive, Emperor Dark Buddhist clearly sees one, and only one truth. No one is to be trusted. Fascists and communists are bickering among each other, democrats and even the Guard are but slithering snakes, ready to strike.\n\nFriendship is dead."
 fso.317.d4:0 "Following Sam and Rivalley, Dark gleefully consumed the cake, and it was so good! Dark relaxed in safety, and even the usual nightmares seemed to avoid him this night. Indeed, he thought, the Senate has his back.\nThe next day, both communist and fascist party headquarters were surprised with a search. Incriminating documents surfaced, showing involvement in sabotage and revealing the fascists as the arsonists behind Senate fire. Popularity of both parties took a sharp turn for the worse!"
 fso.317.d5:0 "Deciding for himself to reveal the truth, Dark surprised all three parties with a surprise raid on their headquarters. Incriminating documents surfaced, showing involvement in sabotage and revealing the fascists as the arsonists behind Senate fire. The Senate was found too busy debating to actually plot anything, which, however, does not improve their standing in public. All three main parties are experiencing a sharp decline in numbers..."
 fso.317.a:0 "Everything for the State!"
 fso.317.b:0 "Everything for the Freundschaft!"
 fso.317.c:0 "It's time to really put \"Dark\" in \"Dark Buddhist\"."
 fso.317.d:0 "Our allegiance is to Republic!"
 fso.317.e:0 "Down with fake ideologies! Long Live the Emperor!"
 fso.318.t:0 "Stability And Safety"
 fso.318.d:0 "Greetings, glorious leader! Now that our party has secured full power, we must make a significant effort to diminish the influence of other parties as much as possible, and improve our stability."
 fso.318.a:0 "Heil Freundschaft!"
 fso.319.t:0 "Make It Reign"
 fso.319.d:0 "Our regime is secure. People believe fully in our guidance, and are willing to sacrifice anything for the State. It seems as our internal politics are the focus of interest internationally, however... Adolf Hitler has taken great interest in our nation now, but the Allies denounced us officially, removing any obligations they previously made."
 fso.319.a:0 "Good riddance!"
 fso.320.t:0 "Shutters Fly"
 fso.320.d:0 "Now that Hitler is truly interested in us, let's show interest in him! Our diplomats will work hard to sign a series of agreements with Germany in the upcoming weeks."
 fso.320.a:0 "Awesome!"
 fso.321.t:0 "Kindness"
 fso.321.d:0 "Our diplomatic mission was a success! Arische Ehefrau and Adolf Hitler personally met in Berlin, where they signed Agreement of Peaceful Cooperation, where many points of conflict have been outlined and resovled. However, this document has a secret article: we support Germany's claims in Austria, militarily if needed, in return for revoking German claims in Sudetenland."
 fso.321.a:0 "We should probably keep our promises."
 fso.321.tt:0 "The Anschluss event is triggered now. Prepare!\n"
 fso.322.t:0 "Call to Arms!"
 fso.322.d:0 "Austrians have refused the German advances! Adolf Hitler made a speech on the radio, in which a formal declaration of war on Austria was issued. This means that according to our agreement we have to declare war also."
 fso.322.tt:0 "We join the war against Austria. Careful with taking their land!\n"
 fso.323.tt:0 "This annuls our agreements!!! Germany will hate us!\n"
 fso.322.b:0 "Nah."
 fso.323.t:0 "Obligations Broken"
 fso.323.d:0 "Oh how could we have been so traitorous? Despite our promises, we took Austrian territory. This nullifies our previous agreements with Germany. Hitler in a public speech called us \"traitors\" and \"backstabbers\". They are mobilizing for war."
 fso.323.a:0 "Are we the baddies?"
 fso.324.t:0 "Negotiations Begin"
 fso.324.d:0 "We have approached the band and offered subsidies, foreign performances and trips as well as taking care of any other management, if Axis Girls agree to sing what we want them to sing."
 fso.324.a:0 "They should agree."
 fso.325.t:0 "Axis Girls"
 fso.325.d:0 "The band agreed to our generous terms. After all, they are very patriotic girls and want to aid us, and taking our offer was an easy decision for them. They will surely be useful!"
 fso.325.a:0 "Their voices are great!"
 fso.326.t:0 "Dashing Over Rainbows"
 fso.326.d:0 "Now that we have shown kindness, let's show loyalty. Germany wants to invade Poland, too? We will help them - if they accept us as allies, of course. Oh, and also we have been thinking about Mussolini, and to be honest we now doubt his usefulness to our alliance - should we suggest Hitler to avoid Italy?"
 fso.326.a:0 "Nah, Mussolini good."
 fso.326.b:0 "I don't think he's good for anything that isn't pasta."
 fso.326.tt:0 "Hitler listens to us!"
 fso.327.t:0 "Loyalty"
 fso.327.d:0 "The arrangements are now complete, and we will cooperate with Wehrmacht in the operation in Poland. In return, we were officially accepted as part of the Axis, and Axis Girls became the symbol of this alliance."
 fso.327.a:0 "Danzig AND War!"
 fso.327.tt:0 "This means war! Be careful with taking Polish land though!"
 fso.328.t:0 "Obligations Broken"
 fso.328.d:0 "Oh how could we have been so traitorous? Despite our promises, we took Polish territory. This nullifies our previous agreements with Germany. Hitler in a public speech called us \"traitors\" and \"backstabbers\". They are mobilizing for war."
 fso.328.a:0 "Are we the baddies?"
 fso.329.t:0 "Cementing Friendships"
 fso.329.d:0 "We have proven loyalty to the Germans and their Reich. They are certainly treating us now as equals, and our people attract each other. Shows of camradery and friendship between our soldiers and Germans are on display everywhere, and many have formed bonds in war against Poland. Hitler is very cheerful - the future seems bright for us and our alliance."
 fso.329.a:0 "Satisfaction is temporary..."
 fso.330.t:0 "Generosity"
 fso.330.d:0 "As a show of our good will, we have decided to abandon all claims in Poland and Austria. In return, Germany is kickstarting our economy, increasing our industrial capacity. Even better perhaps is the cooperation in the armour research. German engineers have shared their panzer plans with us, and together we have managed to create the ultimate war machine - the Schutzengrabenvernichtungsautomobile. This is truly the perfect tank, and none of our enemies will be able to field anything able to resist it. We are ready to start mass-producing these now."
 fso.330.a:0 "Friendship above all!"

 fso.331.a:0 "We will strike together as one!"
 fso.332.t:0 "Operation Thinkable"
 fso.332.d:0 "The plans are drawn, and we are ready to attack Hungary. General Heinz Guderian is going to assist us from now on and in this operation as well. Army is mobilized and is waiting for orders..."
 fso.332.a:0 "Hit them NOW!"
 fso.333.t:0 "We Need To Talk"
 fso.333.d:0 "We knew it from the start and the shared Axis intelligence agencies seem to support it as well. There is no way we can starve Britain into submission, and there is no way we can win a long-lasting conflict. Naval invasion is also impossible, no matter how much wishful thinking we add to the plan.\nEven if our shared forced manage by some crazy play of fate land on the British soil, we still cannot beat the royal navy and ensure proper supply lines. The native population will be hostile and will sabotage each effort to move inland or even establish provisional supply depots and administration centers.\nYet there is a plan we can approach the Führer with – start the invasion internally. Axis girls grew quickly from a local patriotic band to an international voice of the Axis, showing our better, more popular and human face. Young supporters formed their communities not just in the continental part of Europe, but in the Isles as well. With enough Axis girls enthusiasts around, we might be able to take key ports from within! But first, we ought to persuade Axis leadership…"
 fso.333.a:0 "It's time for us to come together!"
 fso.334.t:0 "True True Friends"
 fso.334.d:0 "Never lie! Our German allies had to be taught an important lesson in war planning realities. Hoping for peace with Britain, even if we somehow manage to overrun its European allies, it’s just delusional! The British didn’t give in in the Great War and with their immense resources across the world and strategic position; there is simply no way they would acknowledge Axis dominance over the continent without a bitter fight of complete destruction.\nThe Reichstag, luckily, was willing to listen and opened itself for closer war planning cooperation. At first, the Führer wasn’t happy to be confronted, but eventually embraced our ideas as well. Gaining support within the enemy population first.\nRising popularity of the Axis Girls group certainly is and will be helpful in this endeavor. Let’s give their British tour our special attention!"

 fso.335.t:0 "Welcome to the Show"
 fso.335.d:0 "Our British coup went according to the plan, despite many variables that could have gone wrong. Axis Girls toured from Cornwall all the way to London and then headed north to Liverpool and York. This time we asked them for an extra performance.\nFirst waves consisted of subtle symbols, hyping and controlling the crowd into a form of trans state. The lyrics and light show were designed to send intense subliminal messages in order to create fiercely loyal crowd of supporters, which was happening in smaller scale on all tours. The final stage of this grand crowd control plan commenced as soon as we sent the signal.\nAxis Girls truly did their best today. Songs everyone knew so well by now were unexpectedly but slightly altered and our girls unleashed a smashing wave of catchy songs. Soon they staged a fake scenario in stage, in which they called for a revolution and uprising, among other reasons being suppressed by the British government.\nRage of fanboys burns! Our German allies graciously provided us with convoys and ports to send supplies to these freedom fighters."
 fso.335.a:0 "It was in the heat of a moment!"
 fso.336.t:0 "Smile, Smile, Smile!"
 fso.336.d:0 "Battles are won by more than mere numbers, fancy guns and experience. Our people have seen it first hand and history supports all these claims more than often. Good morale, knowing what you fight for and the bond of brotherhood among soldiers is equally as important as the rest, if not more.\nArmies of Axis stand ready on all borders, plans are made for each outcome and the mood within inner leadership claims its peak. People celebrate in the streets; Axis Girls becoming number one event in most major cities and future seem brighter than ever. All this mental well being can be attributed to our top notch government PR, making sure everyone feels safe, belonging and hyped for the future.\nAs we laugh, though, others dwell in despair. Wellbeing of our people compared to American depression, French unrests or Soviet starvation and oppression shines over our neighbors like sunrays peeking through distant horizon.\nSoon, the well maintained armies of Friendship Order and its allies shall march in the miserable lands of our enemies and spread the light there as well. Overall plan was put to motion this very morning upon meeting of the general staff. Our first move shall be inviting Finland within our ranks. Support in Helsinki for the Axis cause is now overwhelming for the government or any local militia to suppress.\nRight after we get their answers, we march to meet the sun, to the East. Poor people of all Russias shall suffer no more after we’re done with their terrible leaders!"

 fso.337.d:0 "Will we be lost in time or be a part of history? Will our story be told by our grandkids or remain a mystery? Will they sing our songs about all that we have done? Well, the Friendship Order got far beyond the point of no return, and its either glory or defeat now.\nGeneral Staff indeed were busy last night. After receiving a positive reply from Finland, all war plans were greenlit immediately. All allies sent their replies as well, claiming readiness and high morale within their ranks. Although Soviets grew worried about our military movements, the West seems awfully oblivious about our amassing forces. Everyone is sure the French and British would pose no serious threat, especially with our friend Adolf being in charge there.\nWith Finnish forces being ready to storm Leningrad, Germans reporting to be well prepared and rest of our friends having our backs, Luftwaffe ready to blacken the skies and soldiers of all Axis marching from their homes, the moment has arrived to send the last wave of diplomats. With declarations of WAR!"
 fso.337.a:0 "We shall be victors."
 fso.338.t:0 "Land Of Magic?"
 fso.338.d:0 "Not just yet. We might have been marching, bombing, killing, annexing, singing, touring, scheming, dreaming, but it all means nothing until two more key things are done. Consolidating and upholding the vision.\nIt sure was necessary to expand the Axis influence via might of arms, but the shared vision from the start was a world controlled by unity and order, and that’s something we ought to make true, otherwise a serious backlash from foreign peoples will occur.\nKnowing this, our supreme and endlessly wise ruler Arische Ehefrau called out to leaders of all axis countries and suggested a grand conference, where we would finalize our shared plans and divide the world between our direct rule and spheres of influences. Afterwards, it is also important to coordinate social changes, building and other projects and collaborating on keeping peace and rebuilding what have been destroyed."
 fso.338.a:0 "It was long overdue."
 fso.339.t:0 "First Axis Conference"
 fso.339.d:0 "At this lovely day, history of Europe and the world is being written, and these words will surely enter future history books with pride and glory.\nLeaders of our mighty faction finally met to discuss current claims of each nation and future plans as well. Our friend Adolf, as a leader with most radiant personality by far, spoke first, and as a great speaker he is, drove tears of pride to all. He also laid claims to the land of the French, to the Lowlands and British Isles as well. We care little for such God forgotten places and happily supported his demand on spot.\nOur utmost majestic leader spoke second. He might not be as cunning with words, but definitely is not lacking in passion and determination. We, the Friendship State, were always striving for achieving peace through order and unity. Seeing that 20th century Europe will never unite diplomatically, forming Axis was the only way of reaching this seemingly far-fetched goal.\nWith this in mind, claims were laid in our behalf, demanding most of Balkans and surrounding areas. We also promised to embark on a great mission of prosperity.\nSubsequent speeches revealed some of the cultural and administrative struggles across the land occupied by the Axis. Information and plans revealed and discussed by all members served as a great starter of a long conference to be held."
 fso.339.a:0 "So close!"
 fso.340.t:0 "A Party to Remember"
 fso.340.d:0 "After debating, planning a re-drawing, the second official conference finally commenced. The second and last meeting could not start until all members found compromises and agreed to one united Axis plan.\nIt sure was a party to remember! Our boy Adolf opened the conference with previously unseen casual approach, treating the present diplomats more as friends than some officials.\nMeeting quickly turned into quite a merry feast, since there was nothing left to discuss. All members slapped their signatures on Axis Agreement with haste and rushed to taste the Bavarian and Czech beer collection, lying on the conference table yet unclaimed.\nCome what may, our claims now became official rights and if the war goes right, nothing stops us from turning the world to be more fitting place, more similar to our grand vision…"
 fso.340.a:0 "Cheers!"
 fso.341.t:0 "A Beautiful Song"
 fso.341.d:0 "There is something special about Axis Girls. Something which we until this point have not really told anyone about... These girls possess power. Immense power within them, discovered secretly by us. Until now, we have been subtle in its usage. The flames of war rage on now, and we must unleash the Sirens' full potential to win..."
 fso.341.a:0 "Alluring song of madness."
 fso.342.t:0 "\"Siren's Song\""
 fso.342.d:0 "First ever application of music as a weapon of war. Our scientists have developed amulets charged with the power of a Siren. Mass-production is impossible, but we have enough to outfit a special forces unit... \n\n\"Siren's Song\".\n\nThey will be deployed in the hardest, toughest fronts, and no foe shall stop the power unleashed from within their amulets. Survivors will flee in fear, spreading rumours of entire armies falling apart in just one swift offense, obliterating, breaking or enchanting any who stand in the way..."

 fso.344.d:0 "Finally, the pieces of the puzzle are falling into place. For too long we have been oppressed, shunned, badmouthed. Blamed for all the worst this world has to offer. Enough! We fight, not just for our land, not for Axis Girls, but for a Dream. A Dream that one day things will Change, that we will be accepted and that our way of life will become the norm. We fight for Change!"

 fso.345.t:0 "Victory!"
 fso.345.d:0 "We have burned our enemies cities to the ground, and Axis stands victorious over the rubble. Luckily, we have each other - friends and brothers in arms, who we fought alongside with. With the power of Sirens at our disposal, and our bonds stronger than ever, we have made our dream... a Reality.\n\nYou win! Congratulations!"
